**DragonFly** is a [Russian](/intelligence/objects/location--1175a3bd-dd53-4a7e-9cdd-50743079025a) speaking cyber espionage group allegedly operating from Moscow,  active since at least 2011. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, Dragonfly is **operated by the FSB’s 16th Center for information security**, in which few unit’s officers were indicted in 2017 by U.S. authorities for breaching Yahoo!. **Microsoft MSTIC attributes DragonFly to FSB’s Unit 71330.**

Dragonfly activity originated with the use of **Havex malware** and later, **watering holes against energy and utilities companies in North America and Europe**. 

The **[Federal Security Service](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--9593a575-566d-4f58-96a0-45c95356d511)** of the Russian Federation (**FSB**) is one the main intelligence agencies and the **successor of the Soviet Union KGB**. Its missions are to insure counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance as well as investigating some other types of serious crimes and federal law violations. **In opposition to military intelligence agency GRU, APTs linked to FSB** (such as Dragonfly) **focus more on targeted  cyber espionage, internal and international, than destructive operations** (prepositioning and actual cyber sabotage).

The FSB is also the main agency that **regulates laws** with the aim of **reaching technological independence and information control** in a Russian pseudo-closed internet. In march 2018, FSB asked for Telegram’s encryption keys, a Russian messaging service that provides end-to-end encrypted communications. Facing Telegram rejection, medias surveillance administration Roskomnadzor threatened to shut down Telegram in Russia.

Dragonfly cyber operations used to target defense and aviation companies. In early 2013, the group shifted to mostly **targeting western energy industries** and **companies relying on industrial control systems** (ISC) by using a modular malware dubbed “Havex”. This malware was sent as a validator to the victims through emails, strategic web compromise and trojanized installers downloadable from legitimate ICS software editors websites. 

**While this threat actor has major capabilities in breaching critical infrastructure there has been so far no evidence of disruptive effect of these attacks**. During this campaign Dragonfly focused on intelligence gathering from ICS networks with an unknown intent, potentially to allow a disruptive operation in case of political need. The CISA and FBI have warned U.S. organizations about the possibility of implanting malware into their networks to cause damage in future attacks. 

**A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as DragonFly 2.0**. There is some doubt about the extent of the overlap between the first and the second operations, that’s why some cybersecurity professionals track them as **separate APTs**. However, the fact that the targets are the same and that some tools have not changed leads us to believe that it is the same threat actor with a slightly different arsenal (the group drops the Oldrea backdoor but still uses Heriplor, Karagany, Listrix). **Dragonfly and Dragonfly 2.0 could be operated by two teams working on the same FBS unit or bureau.**

Technically, the group is known to exploit routers and Public-Facing Application for initial access (Citrix CVE-2019-19781, Microsoft Exchange CVE-2020-0688, Fortinet VPN CVE-2018-13379) but **is not known to exploit 0-day as other Russian sponsored groups**. The initial access is mostly done via spear phishing emails and strategic website compromises with malicious SMB inclusion, allowing the attackers to retrieve NTLM hashes of the victim to be brute forced and then, reused. This kind of malicious inclusion is also done via malicious documents, embedding a malicious remote template requesting an SMB share.

The group was observed (by Talos and Symantec) targeting entities in Middle-East, specifically Palestine and Israel, on sectors including government, military, financial, media, education, energy, and think tanks.  
AridViper is possibly linked to Palestinian interests, some cybersecurity vendors **linked the group to the Hamas political organization**.

The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices.

Of note, as North Korean intrusion sets  display significant overlap and shared toolbox, the name Lazarus Group used in open sources is known to encompass a broad range of activity. SEKOIA complies to differentiate North Korea aligned intrusion sets as much as possible and consider Bluenoroff, APT37, and KIMSUKY to be differentiated. 

Lazarus is a dual-hatted Intrusion Set, whose primary motivation is **espionage**, with a secondary motivation pertaining to **revenue generation**. While heavily relying on **wipers** in **destructive** attacks against the U.S. and South Korea **until 2015**, Lazarus since evolved to leverage signature malware including **ransomware** (VHD), **trojanized applications** (DeFi wallet, Dacls RAT), **spyware** (Manuscrypt) and framework (MATA) alongside **open source and zero-day vulnerabilities**, in lucrative and espionage campaigns against a broader victimology.

Longstading **verticals of interest include the defence industry as well as finance and cryptocurrencies platforms and users**. Based on past observed activities, notably in surge capacity times such as Covid epidemic, Lazarus, similarily to Kimsuky, can temporarily shift their focus to target unusual sectors and / or countries. In 2021, Lazarus was also seen conducting a campaign against **security researchers**, notably leveraging **social networks** and **supply chain attack**.

To date, observed Lazarus victimology includes - defence and military contractors and companies, cryptocurrency, media, banks, freight logistics, healthcare, chemical industry,  in Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the Middle East, Latin America and the U.S..

	stix:description """**APT28** is a Russia-nexus intrusion set attributed by Western intelligence services to [Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--ca2f2a66-74c5-4c68-80a3-ec43478d8f50**) 85th Main Special Service Center** (GTsSS) Military **Unit 26165**. This intrusion set, which started its operations in 2004 against occidental Military networks, is especially known for its hybrid operations on the sidelines of armed conflict and diplomatic crises related to Russia. 

It was in 2014 with a report called \"Operation Pawn Storm\" released by Trend Micro that the  public became aware of this intrusion set. Since then, APT28 has made the headlines during several espionage, destabilization and sabotage operations.

Its intrusion techniques are most often singular, such as spear phishing using a malicious attachment or leading to a watering hole, credentials theft by using malicious emails associated with domain typo-squatting or dns hijacking. APT28 is also known for achieving VPN / RDP frontal compromises and IOT compromises in order to get a foothold in the targeted networks. This intrusion set is also suspected to have achieved at least one attack by a supply chain in central Asia.

The APT28 intrusion set was designated historically by its tools, that are for a large part developed internally, such as the malicious code X-TUNNEL, the X-AGENT backdoor, the UEFI rootkit dubbed “[LoJax](/intelligence/objects/malware--293bc1ee-5d2e-4d07-8e78-e2c31df62cf9)\", or the CORESHELL validator. Using these tools mostly during its operations, APT28 seems to have left them for the use of open source offensive tools.

Other tools targeting different platforms have also been identified such as an [Android implant](/intelligence/objects/malware--4c8a56d1-4bb9-4827-ad2d-faa402cdefa4) spread to Ukrainian gunners on the Donbass Front as well as IOS and OSX versions of the X-AGENT implant.

The operations of the APT28 intrusion set were closely linked to the operations of another threat actor dubbed \"[Sandworm](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--f29bd8cc-1cea-497c-ac3f-8d590b95c9d6)\", \"Blackenergy\" or \"Hades\". This second intrusion set has been attributed to another GRU unit, the unit 74455. It seems that these two threat actors worked together during several operations, APT28 giving the lead to Sandworm on some destabilization campaigns (Ukrainian crisis, US and French presidential elections). 

The distinction between these two intrusion sets is most often done from the tools used, Sandworm preferring open source offensive tools such as [Empire](/intelligence/objects/malware--43650dc8-980b-4b5f-9646-476cccbae2f7) or [Metasploit](/intelligence/objects/tool--57f456d7-20b2-4609-859e-54d9238946f0) during its operations. Which is now harder to perform now since APT28 also switched to open source tools.

### Campaigns

APT28 has become famous for its destabilization campaigns during several crisis contexts since 2013. APT28 was customary in the creation of fake hacktivist groups to allow the spreading of stolen information (emails, documents) from its victims or the claim of successful attacks. APT28 is also known for modifying stolen documents before making them public to increase the impact of destabilization. Here is a non-exhaustive list of several false flags and hacktivist groups operated by APT28, sometimes with the support of the Sandworm intrusion set.

|  Avatar/FalseFalg/Operation  | Context |  Use |  Attribution confidence |
|----------|---------------|-------|----------|
| CyberBerkut | Ukrainian crisis | Sabotage, leaks | High | 
| YemeniCyberArmy | Yemeni crisis | Leaks | High | 
| SyrianCyberArmy | Syrian crisis | DDoS attacks | High | 
| CyberCaliphate | Russia-occident tensions | Sabotage, Leaks | High | 
| Fancy Bear | Olympic Games doping ban | Leaks | High | 
| DCLeaks | US presidential elections 2016 | Leaks | High | 
| GUCCIFER 2.0 | US presidential elections 2016 | Leaks | High | 
| MacronLeaks | FR presidential elections | Leaks | High (Sandworm) | 
| OlympicDestroyer/Lazarus | Olympic Games doping ban, Pyeongchang. | Sabotage | Medium (Sandworm) | 
| RANA Leaks | Undetermined | Leaks | Low (overlaps with APT28 infrastructure & TTPs) | 

In its latest operations, APT28 seems to have gradually abandoned the creation of hacktivist avatars - which may have been judged too discriminating and heavy to implement - to give documents directly to journalists, influencers, or on several forums.

Following some operational security mistakes carried out by its operators and lawsuits engaged by occidental countries, a public attribution was carried out against this intrusion set. The attribution led to the public designation of several operators working within Units 26165 and 74455.

Following these lawsuits, the historical APT28 intrusion set (using its own tools, a discriminant infrastructure and carrying out false flags) seems to have mutated or disappeared. No more articles mentioning new attack campaigns associated with APT28 have been published since 2019.

In 2021, CLUSTER25 reported the use of a backdoor dubbed \"[Skinny Boy](/intelligence/objects/malware--fa9a8c0d-1193-4bc1-8290-5c3a0dcbcc43)\" which had potential links with APT28. However, the analysis of the backdoor and the context (mainly the associated infrastructure) done by SEKOIA.IO could not link it with high confidence to an APT28 resurgence.

The temporary end of the APT28 and Sandworm intrusion sets seem to have coincided with the resurgence of another Russian-speaking threat actor on the stage: [NOBELIUM](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--7dbe6e76-c59f-4dec-a7cf-c2a7e0210d16)/APT29, linked to the [SVR](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--de741e1a-061d-449f-a7d8-8d8aee0069b1). This resurgence of APT29 could indicate the Kremlin preference for other intelligence services to engage in cyber operations. This choice could be directly linked to the past errors of APT28 and Sandworm.

In 2022, Trellix attributed an attack to APT28 targeting Western Asia. Trellix found a new malware dubbed Graphite using Microsoft OneDrive as C2.

A report from Cluster25 researchers described a phishing technique used by fancybear since at least February 2022. The group uses a PowerShell Slide Show (.pps) document which execute a PowerShell code contained in its 'HyperLinks' metadata when the user opens it in presentation mode and move its mouse over it.

### New TTPs

Over the current **Russia-Ukraine war**, APT28 conducted **widespread phishing campaigns** to collect information to **provide political and military advantage**, and relied on opportunistic access through historical compromise to conduct **destructive cyber attacks**.

These recent attacks saw the emergence of new TTPs. APT28 today seems to prefer the use of disposable implants often developed in interpreted languages such as **Javascript**, **Powershell** or simple **bat scripts**, created specifically for each campaign. Their implants are not sophisticated at all and often linked to carrying out a single task such as creating a tunnel, recovering & exfiltrating passwords & co.

APT28 also seems to have switched from registered VPS and domains to **Mockbin services**, **TOR (for tunneling)** and **compromised network appliances** to create their operational infrastructure. This prevent easy correlation from a Threat Intelligence perspective.""" ;

	stix:description """**EMBER BEAR** (aka Lorec53, UNC2589, UAC-0056) is a **Russia**-nexus intrusion set, active since at least 2020. Although no public attribution nor association is confirmed, EMBER BEAR shows consistent interests with [Russian military intelligence **GRU**](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--ca2f2a66-74c5-4c68-80a3-ec43478d8f50) : victimology (Ukrainian gouvernement and energy sector) and TTPs (the use of straitforward wipers against Ukraine)

On January 31, 2022, CERT-UA publicly attributed attack targeting an energy organization in Ukraine to a threat group they track as UAC-0056 also known as EMBER BEAR. In the following days, Unit42 and NSFOCUS shared more details on the intrusion set, its modus operandi and the previous campaigns attributed to the threat group. The UAC-0056 threat group is tracked as TA471 by Proofpoint, SaintBear by ThreatBook, Lorec53 by NSFOCUS, EMBER BEAR by CrowdStrike, and Nodaria by Symantec.

EMBER BEAR launched large-scale cyber espionage attacks against Eastern Europe targets (Ukraine, Georgia) and also against Iran. The publicly shared campaigns all seem to target government entities. According to NSFOCUS analysis:
>UAC-0056 (aka Lorec53) exposed a large number of Russian hacker characteristics in terms of attack tools, domain name registration information, asset location, etc., and its attack targets are also closely related to Russia's national interests. A study of UAC-0056's (aka Lorec53) development trajectory found that the organization was suspected of being employed by other high-level espionage organizations to obtain revenue by undertaking state-level espionage attacks or selling confidential government documents.
>UAC-0056 (aka Lorec53) has strong infiltration ability and changeable attack methods. It can organize large-scale and high-density phishing attacks. It is also good at learning from other organizations' social engineering technology and network resource management methods.

Beginning on April 6, 2021, just weeks after Russia began massing troops and military equipment
on the Ukrainian border, Ember Bear sent phishing emails to at least 1,966 unique recipients in Ukraine. 

The threat group is using OutSteel and SaintBot payloads, and they are also using different social engineering themes and infection chains to compromise systems. In several phishing campaignes, they used law enforcement theme based emails to lure the victim.

##### Toolset

UAC-0056 uses multiple custoù Golang implants since early 2022:
* Elephant Dropper: A dropper
* Elephant Downloader: A downloader
* SaintBot: A downloader
* OutSteel: Information stealer
* GrimPlant (aka Elephant Implant): Collects system information and maintains persistence
* GraphSteel (aka Elephant Client): Information stealer
* Graphiron: download & information stealer

An analysis of Threatray researchers pointed that the Graphiron and Elephant samples, both attributed to Ember Bear share a similar string decryption routine. In the samples, each string have their own hardcoded decryption routine. Even though these routine differ in terms of instructions, they are similar in terms of flow graph and semantic. These decryption routines are very specific to UAC-0056 and can be used to track their toolset.

Mallox is a ransomware group clamiming to encrypt victims' data and demanding a ransom not to leak it. Mallox distributes [the group’s namesake ransomware](/intelligence/objects/malware--ce7a3bf8-fae6-4ab1-97b8-51c55cea556e) known as Mallox, Fargo, TargetCompany etc. since at least June 2021.

So far, the group's internal organisation and its structure remain unclear to the public. On the Mallox Dark Web site, they and introduce four categories of \"staff\" people: `Admin`, `Support`, `Team` and `Panda`. They also [declare](https://www.suspectfile.com/interview-with-mallox-ransomware-group/) they are \"a very small group of just a couple of people\" ant that they operate from the \"European region\". It is likely composed by former members of other ransomware groups.

On their negociation panel with victims, Mallox operators declare to communicate in English only.
 
The ransom note contains instructions on how to contact the attackers. It urges victims to contact them via their TOR live chat (since at least October 2022) by logging in with a given personal ID, or to send it to a specific email address.

The ransom demands have been reported to range from $1000 to $60,000. SEKOIA.IO found that in the case of a Colombian-based victim, the ransom amount was reduced from $50,000 to $20,000 within a two-week period.

Figure: Mallox' negociations with an unnamed victim (SEKOIA.IO, February 2023)

## Initial access
As of August 2023, the intrusion set is reported to mainly exploit vulnerable SQL Servers to gain access.

## Double Extortion
In the ransom notes from late 2021 - early 2022 seen by SEKOIA, the ransomware actors only asked for a ransom to decrypt victims' data.

Later in 2022, the group started to communicate about its double extortion tactic by threatening to publish the victims' stolen data initially on Twitter (starting from August 2022) and Telegram: \"In case of non-payment of the ransom, your data may be published in the public domain\".

Then beginning from November 2022, Mallox started to use a dedicated TOR site for double extortion. When a victim does not pay the ransom, the exfiltrated data is released on the group's public data leak site and on Twitter.

Sometimes the ransomware actors also threaten to contact the victims' partners (\"we will let them know that you were the source of the data leak\"). They also warn European victims that they are at risk of contravening the GDPR principles if the stolen data ends up being published on the group's websites.

From the public samples that SEKOIA has collected, at least one victim initiated discussions and negociations with the ransomware group in February 2023.

## Victimology

Mallox ransomware targets entities of all sizes, worldwide - except some post-Soviet states. 

The victims identified by SEKOIA.IO in open source ranged from $5M to $782M in annual revenue.

According to information collected in late 2021-early 2023, victims of the ransomware included: an architectural firm in Germany, an American and a Japanese manufacturing companies, a Greek waste management company and several Indian companies, among others.

On the Mallox DLS, stolen data from 20 victims was released between 21 October 2022 and 24 March 2023.""" ;

	stix:description """**Killnet** is a Russia-aligned hacktivist  group active since at least January 2022 as a Telegram messaging service selling distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack services. The group conduct DDoS, espionnage and hack-and-leaks operations on targets identified as anti-Russian.

Killnet is particullary active in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, and cooperates with other Russia-aligned hacktivist groups such as Zarya, NoNames057, Anonymous Russia, UserSec, and Anonymous Sudan. In February 2023, the Phoenix hacktivist group officially became part of Killnet.

On April 2023, Killnet operators announced the group official name is now:  **Russian Private Military hacker Company Killnet** (aka PMC Killnet or ЧВХК KILLNET). PMC Killnet aims at providing various services including destruction, production of UAVs, and means of tracking and suppression of drones, development of robotic systems, and software development, (the ‘destruction’ services include actions such as misinformation, impact on network infrastructure, and reputation killing). PMC Killnet additionally planned to update the list of its services, as it acquires specialists and expands partnerships in the CIS and abroad. 

According to their Telegram Channels (@killnet_channel and others such as @cyberwar_world, @Legion_Russia, @world_hacker_alliance), they are organised in 3 groups:
* a \"strike\" group (\"Ударная группа\"), composed of so-called experts in penetration tests, phishing and DDOS;
* a group composed of graphic designer;
* a group in charge of media communication.

The group also uses VKontakte to communicate.
<br>
On March 4th 2022, they declared working with **XakNet Team**.
<br>
Based on open-source reporting, Killnet released a video pledging support to Russia.
<br>

## TTPs
### DDOS
<br>

According to researchers from Forescout, Killnet’s attack vector of choice is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). They don’t use or develop custom tools and the tools they do use are not very advanced. The group leverage brute-forcing credentials on TCP ports 21 (FTP), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) and 22 (SSH).
<br>

Killnet claimed credit for carrying out a DDoS attack against a U.S. airport in March 2022 in response to U.S. equipment support for Ukraine.
<br>

### Data Leak
<br>
Killnet also claimed data leaks
<br>

## Victimology
<br>

Killnet is a group targeting Ukraine and Pro-Ukraine entities, as well as countries considered as \"Anti-Russia\". Reported targeted verticals include critical infrastructure, such as airports, banks, hospitals, intelligence services, transport systems, public services, and private organizations.
<br>

On June 2022, Killnet took responsibility for a days-long DDoS attack on Lithuanian’s public services, asserting the hit was a direct response to the blockade of goods imposed by Vilnius to the Russian territory of Kaliningrad.
<br>

In December 2022, Killnet claimed responsability for defacing an Australian building company.
<br>

## Organisation
<br>

Here is an overview of Killnet's organisation and ecosystem, as documented in open sources ( please see external ref)

Killnet and associates developed botnets and stressors, using open-source GitHub repositories. They also collaborate with DDoS-as-a-Service providers, and stressor developers to achieve their goals. Some of the key players are Mirai Botnet, Passion Botnet, Tesla-Botnet; built by RADIS, MistNet,  SkyNet Botnet, and Godzilla-BotNet. Most of them are DDoS-as-a Service providers. Some of them are built and managed by KILLNET associates, like Tesla-Botnet. Passion Botnet and MistNet are directly associated with Killnet and engaged in DDoS campaigns.


In April 2023, threat actors related to [Titan Stealer](/intelligence/objects/malware--c9918ab7-0845-4165-902b-2aa6e7b82d2d) integrated the KillNet galaxy. The announcement was made on the KillMilk (a structure within the KillNet galaxy) Telegram channel on 16 April 2023. On their own Telegram channel, Titan Stealer actors listed KillNet as a \"DDoS partner\".

Since April 2023, Killnet is present on Twitter. The group also announced the formation of Black Skills, a Private Military Hacking Company on Telegram. For the time being, Sekoia.io analysts will continue tracking Kilmik's activities under the Killnet intrusion set.""" ;

	stix:description """## Business

The MedusaLocker operators conducted its first attack in January 2020. The group is known to target large businesses, networks of organizations and companies. It first used the ThunderX ransomware and then renamed it Ranzy Locker after making some changes on the malware. 

From CISA analysis:

> MedusaLocker appears to operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model based on the observed split of ransom payments. Typical RaaS models involve the ransomware developer and various affiliates that deploy the ransomware on victim systems. MedusaLocker ransomware payments appear to be consistently split between the affiliate, who receives 55 to 60 percent of the ransom; and the developer, who receives the remainder. 


## TTPs

Recent CISA advisory gives interesing information regarding the operator using [MedusaLocker](/intelligence/objects/malware--4eb87fe0-1f6a-4bbb-87b8-4ac5561e80de):

> MedusaLocker ransomware actors most often gain access to victim devices through vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations [T1133]. Actors also frequently use email phishing and spam email campaigns—directly attaching the ransomware to the email—as initial intrusion vectors [T1566].
> 
> MedusaLocker actors place a ransom note into every folder containing a file with the victim's encrypted data. The note outlines how to communicate with the MedusaLocker actors, typically providing victims one or more email address at which the actors can be reached. The size of MedusaLocker ransom demands appears to vary depending on the victim’s financial status as perceived by the actors. 
> 
Ahnlab asses the group also used [GlobeImposter](/intelligence/objects/malware--3cade096-ad69-40c1-8034-58fe56090ca0) instead of MedusaLocker in its attacks in early 2023. Also, not only do the MedusaLocker threat actors encrypted infected systems using their ransomware, but they also mine for coins by installing XMRig.

	stix:description """**APT33** is an Iranian state-sponsored APT active since at least 2013. It has targeted organizations across multiple industries in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, with a **particular and continued focus** on the **aviation** and **energy sectors**. Due to the overlap with other Iranian APTs, its destructive capacities and shared victimology, SEKOIA.IO concurs to the public  **attribution to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps**.

The [**Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps**](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--dc788f6a-94ed-44f6-b935-fe8d9c923a2b) (IRCG) is an ideology-driven militia, branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, under the direct control of the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. IRGC does not  answer to Iranian presidency. The Revolutionary Guards are in charge of protecting the iranian regime by  monitoring internal “deviant movements” and preventing foreign interference and coups. IRGC can be seen as an military elite corps with specific missions, including cyber capabilities to conduct espionage, sabotage and deception operations. 

Little information is available about Iran's internal cyber organization, which is known to cyber security researchers to be cloudy and evolutive. Due to the **use of proxy groups** and the **turnover of operators** from intelligence agencies to another, **Iranian intrusion sets often overlap TTPs, tools, infrastructures and modus operandi**. Thus attribution to Iranian intelligence agency, to proxy groups such as private firms or university institutes, or even the regroupment or differentiation of APTs has to be cautiously considered. 

Based on open-source publications, observed TTPs **overlap in between APT33 and APT35**, notably observed in the destructive campaign Shamoon (2012) could indicate operational coordination between these two intrusion sets.

Open-sources publications report that APT33 conducted operations with the support of different IRGC-aligned proxy groups notably including but not restricted to Nars Institute, Ashiyane Digital Security Team, Shahid Beheshti University (SBU), SBU’s Cyberspace Research Institute, Imam Hossein University and the Iranian Dark Coders Team.

*Dragos* differences **PARISITE** and **MAGNALLIUM**: \"PARISITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive or destructive capability, demonstrating only initial access and enabling further operations for MAGNALLIUM.\"

**Iran attribution complexity**

Little information is available about Iran's internal cyber organization or doctrine, which is known to cyber security researchers to be cloudy and evolutive. Due to the use of proxy entities and the turnover of operators from one intelligence agency to another, Iranian intrusion sets often overlap as indicated by observed TTPs, tools, infrastructures and modus operandi over time. Thus, attribution to Iranian intelligence agency, to proxy entities such as private companies, universities or institutes, or even the grouping of or differentiation between APTs has to be cautiously considered.

**Iran cyber policy**

Iran does not present a public cyber strategy. However, the observed use of its capabilities shows a rational use of this tool, following three goals: to ensure the stability and maintenance of the regime by monitoring dissidents; to protect its territory focusing on intelligence gathering about adversary military intentions; and to promote and secure its regional ambitions by using cyber as a power-projection tool.""" ;

First observed in June 2022, the Play ransomware crew operates the [Play ransomware](/intelligence/objects/malware--33c47630-95c6-4670-92a3-bbbd8af40aa9) in double extortion attacks.

According to TrendMicro, the group uses many tactics that follow the playbook of both Hive and Nokoyawa ransomware, thus there is a high probability of affiliation between these ransomware families. TrendMicro also found evidence that points to a possible connection between Play ransomware and Quantum ransomware,

## TTPs and Tools
Here are the TTPs and tools used by the Play ransomware crew, based on TrendMicro report:
* **Initial Access**: gains initial access through valid accounts (VPN, exposed RDP, _etc._), using techniques such as remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, by compromising remote desktop software credentials and by exploiting FortiOS vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2020-12812. In August 2023, Adlumin Team reported on Play expanding its toolkit with new tools and exploits like ProxyNotShell, OWASSRF, and a Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution. 
* **Execution**: uses the Empire, SystemBC and Cobalt Strike post-exploitation frameworks, PsExec, creation of GPOs to deploy scheduled task from the AD and batch files. 
* **Privilege escalation**: uses Nekto/PriviCMD, Mimikatz and WinPEAS.
* **Persistence**: uses scheduled tasks and valid accounts. 
* **Defense Evasion**: uses tools such as Process Hacker, GMER, IOBit, and PowerTool to disable antimalware and monitoring solutions. The group uses .bat script and _wevtutil_ to remove indicators of its presence, such as logs in Windows Event Logs or malicious files. It disables Windows Defender protection capabilities through PowerShell or command prompt.
* **Credential Access**: uses Mimikatz to dump credentials, executed as module of Cobalt Strike and Empirer.
* **Discovery**: uses common ADFind, Nltest and Bloodhound tool for enumerating system and domain information.   
* **Lateral Movement**:
  * uses Cobalt Strike SMB beacon as a C&C beacon, a method of lateral movement, and a tool for downloading and executing files;
  * uses SystemBC, a SOCKS5 proxy, for backdooring mechanisms;
  * uses Empire for post-exploitation activity;
  * uses Mimikatz to dump credentials and gain domain administrator access on victim networks to conduct lateral movement.
* **Collection**: archives collected data using WinRAR
* **Exfiltration**: uses WinSCP, an SFTP client and FTP client for Microsoft Windows.

## Custom malware
In April 2023, researchers at Symantec uncovered two custom tools in .NET developed by the Play ransomware group, namely `Grixba` and `VSS Copying Tool`. 
* **`Grixba`** is a network-scanning and information-stealing tool used to enumerate users and computers in a domain. 
* **`VSS Copying Tool`** enables Play ransomware to steal files from existing shadow volume copies even when those files are in use by applications.

## Network Infrastructure

<br>

While observed continuously targeting Mongolia, Mustang Panda also targets **non-governmental organizations** involved in diplomacy (including the  Vatican, Myanmar, African and Asian countries), **think-tanks** (notably in the U.S.), **government** (Taiwan) as well as activists and ethnic minorities (Hong Kong, Tibet, Myanmar, Afghanistan), the **telecommunication vertical** in India, and **European countries**.
<br>

Mustang Panda mostly leverages lure documents mimicking those of the targeted country or organization, or even current world affairs applicable to that region, to conduct **spearphishing campaigns** to deploy malware, mostly **[PlugX aka. SOGU](/intelligence/objects/malware--1bd27a17-2c45-4864-bc7c-b2c77ddd17ac)**. Mustang Panda was also observed leveraging a unique infection chain using a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems. From September through November 2022, Mustang Panda regularly used an infection chain employing malicious shortcut (LNK) files, which trigger a dynamic-link library (DLL) search-order-hijacking execution chain to load consistently updated PlugX versions. In November 2022, the Intrusion Set was observed shifting from using archive files to using malicious optical disc image (ISO) files containing a simplified shortcut (LNK) file for delivery of **an updated PlugX payload dubbed [HODUR](/intelligence/objects/malware--f6a5abe3-37e9-4cbb-a41b-2364729570dd)**.
<br>

In recent activities, Mustang Panda was reported leveraging  legitimate executables to side-load a malicious DLL, and a malicious DLL used to load RATs as part of its infection chain. In some campaigns, the Intrusion Set expanded its toolset to include reverse shells, [meterpreter](/intelligence/objects/tool--38d6ece7-4244-4dcd-a4fe-5c150c561b8b) and [Cobalt Strike](/intelligence/objects/malware--39304fbf-d301-47c3-ab06-7c96e5eb4c9b). In March 2022, Mustang Panda was reported targeting  **Russian-speaking users** and **European entities**. It is not clear yet whether this unusual victimology was only temporary or could reflect a shift or an expansion of Mustang Panda strategic assignments.

	stix:description """## Overview

Formerly known as ABCD ransomware, LockBit is active since September 2019 and acts as an opportunistic, financially motivated intrusion set. LockBit is one of the most prolific ransomware groups in the cybercrime landscape, distributing ransomware as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and recruiting affiliates on popular underground forums.  LockBit 2.0 ransomware is one of the most active families in the wild and pretends to implement the fastest encryption algorithms using multithreading with I/O completion ports.

LockBit was one of the most active ransomware groups during the last two years and claimed the highest number of victims among all the for-profit ransomware groups in the first half of 2022 (439 victims announced on its extortion page, which represents 32,5% of all known ransomware attacks during S1 2022).

## LockBit’s continued evolution

Though the RaaS group **first advertised its affiliate program in January 2020**, its victim count rose exponentially mid-year 2021 onward when it **announced “LockBit 2.0**” - an updated version of the malicious program. A recruitment program was also launched for their new affiliates. This relaunch included redesigned Tor sites and numerous advanced features. The 2.0 version included automatic encryption of devices across Windows domains by abusing Active Directory (AD) group policies, prompting the group behind it to claim that it’s one of the fastest ransomware variants in the market today.

In August 2021, LockBit 2.0 began to advertise for insiders to establish initial access into potential victim networks, while promising a portion of the proceeds from a successful attack. 

LockBit 2.0 also developed a Linux-based malware which takes advantage of vulnerabilities within VMWare ESXi virtual machines. 

In March 2022, Lockbit ransomware group announced they intend to release **LockBit 3.0**. This new, upgraded version of the malware has already been spotted in malicious campaigns by May 2022. LockBit 3.0 affiliates get access to malware developed by the group, in return for a 20% share of the ransom payments.

In late 2022, the ransomware actors adopted the leaked Conti ransomware source code to create a custom **LockBit Green** variant.

## Internal Structure & Affiliates

LockBit representatives claim to be a large Netherlands-based group, with a strong affiliate network across the world, with “most of their developers and partners were born and grew up in the Soviet Union”.

Based on a report released by Prodaft in June 2021, at least 28 different affiliates were identified based on their management panel analysis.

LockBit does not allow the use of its ransomware in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries as notably stated on their Data Leak Site (DLS). In an August 2021 interview, LockBit representatives mentioned: “For us, the unfriendly attitude of the West [towards Russia] is beneficial. It makes it possible to have such an aggressive business and feel calm operating from the CIS countries\".

From Sekoia.io’s observations of the newly launched affiliate program (LockBit 3.0 aka LockBit Black), the LockBit group is looking for partners with varying levels of expertise and experience within the cybercrime business. It is highly likely that this is driven by LockBit to  widen and diversify its team and leveraged TTPs for LockBit 3.0 project, ultimately aiming at conducting more successful cybercriminal activities.
The main types of affiliates currently wanted are:
1. “cohesive and experienced teams of pentesters”;
2. Initial Access Brokers (IABs);
3. threat actors stealing data without encrypting it.

### Identified affiliates

1. Sekoia.io analyst published a [FLINT](/intelligence/objects/report--4788ad4e-aad9-469a-b170-028268b22d26) on 17 March 2023 exposing one of LockBit affiliate TTPs and infrastructure. This [LockBit Affiliate - Ransomware tool and exfiltration servers](/intelligence/objects/infrastructure--a1e942c7-a1ed-4e50-9a9d-2caed5f5d767) is kept up to date in Intelligence Center.
This affiliate uses  [Empire](/intelligence/objects/malware--43650dc8-980b-4b5f-9646-476cccbae2f7) OST as a post-exploitation tool and [ExMatter](/intelligence/objects/malware--ca72eb65-fc1e-48b5-9765-f0094b6ddbc5) for exfiltration.

2. On 16 May 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Russian national Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev for his role in launching cyberattacks deploying ransomware variants such as LockBit, Hive, and Babuk. The FBI linked Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev to the [Wazawaka aka UNC1756](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--b8876b62-a791-4ebf-bc91-9e4dd3be12e2) persona. According to [Prodaft](https://25491742.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25491742/WAZAWAKA_TLPCLEAR_Report.pdf), it operated under the `waza` nickname and was involved in LockBit attacks on 67 targets from May 2020 to March 2021.

3. Here is a list of LOckBit affiliates provided by Prodaft in December 2023:

![](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v2/inthreat/images/336017d54b92d2bd782875cd76e37f56ff0d3aa9ae9a4e56ab6110122af3409e.png)

## Possible connections between LockBit and other ransomware groups 

To the best of our knowledge, there is no clear link of LockBit with any other known threat actor. However, Trend Micro noted in 2021 that LockBit operators initially worked with the Maze ransomware cartel. After Maze’s shutdown the LockBit group went on with its own leak site, which reportedly led to the development of its own ransomware. Two years later, the same source reported LockBit 2.0 similarities to Ryuk and Egregor ransomware.

In a June 2021 report, the Prodraft Threat Intelligence team reported some of the LockBit affiliates might also have worked for the Babuk and REvil ransomware groups.

The LockBit 3.0 version used since mid-2022 has some code similarities with samples related to the BlackMatter ransomware. It appears that the code in charge of loading its required functions for both LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter uses API hashing technique with the same hashing algorithm (ror13_add). The algorithm used to import the functions by their hashes is the same for LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter (ror13_add, but with different XOR keys), the hashing algorithm used for the module name is add_ror13. Moreover, both ransomware attempt to hide the main thread from the debugger.

These similarities would raise concerns about a possible link between the gangs behind LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter. Whether the link between the two groups is formal or casual, the code similarities between LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter are providing additional weight to the hypothesis that different ransomware groups, particularly those of Russian origin, are increasingly interconnected.

As LockBit Geen variant rely on the Conti source code, Prodaft asses that ex-Conti members might joined the LockBit operation after the Conti syndicate disbanded earlier in 2022.

## Modus operandi

The modus operandi observed during the attacks involving LockBit seems compatible with an financially motivated, opportunistic actor. Its operators adopted the same double extorsion method as other top-tier ransomware families with a dedicated leak site.

Like other ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, LockBit looks for affiliates to perform the intrusion and exfiltration on targets. Thus, the developers are in charge of the payment site and development and affiliates sign up to distribute the ransomware.

For initial access to a targeted corporate network, the LockBit gang recruits affiliates who perform the actual intrusion on targets, usually via valid remote desktop protocol (RDP) account credentials using common phishing and credentialing techniques. 

A network scanner takes stock of the network structure and identifies target domain controllers. Once in the domain controller, the ransomware creates new group policies and sends them to every device on the network. These policies disable Windows Defender, and distribute and execute the ransomware binary to each Windows machine.

This main ransomware module goes on to append the “.lockbit” suffix to every encrypted file. Then, it drops a ransom note into every encrypted directory threatening double extortion.

(Source : https://www.cynet.com/attack-techniques-hands-on/malware-evolution-analyzing-lockbit-2-0)

The final step for LockBit 2.0 is changing the victims’ desktop wallpapers into an advertising campaign recruitment ad to recruit new “affiliates” from inside the targeted companies themselves, which also includes instructions on how victims can pay the ransom. The average ransom amount is calculated to be roughly $85,000, as of June 2021. 

**Stealing data**

For data exfiltration, the ransomware comprises a built-in information-stealing trojan called StealBit, which is used for establishing access and automatically downloading files from an attacked company to LockBit’s updated blog. Before starting the encryption, LockBit affiliates use the StealBit trojan to steal files of their choice.

This is the second time a custom data exfiltration tool appears to have been developed by ransomware operators, following the earlier discovery of the Ryuk Stealer tool.

**Fast Encryption**

The strength of LockBit operators is, as the group claims, the fastest encryption speed among all ransomware available in the market currently. Moreover, the ransomware group claims it operates the world’s fastest stealer - StealBit.

LockBit actors often use publicly available file-sharing services such as anonfiles[.]com, privatlab[.]net, fex[.]net, transfer[.]sh, send.exploit[.]in, and sendspace[.]com. The data are saved in packages and uploaded to cloud services, such as MEGA.

According to Trend Micro, LockBit is only partially encrypting the files, as only 4 KB of data are encrypted per file. 

## The double extortion threat

LockBit attackers exfiltrate sensitive data and threaten to release it publicly if the ransom demand is not met. This tactic, employed by multiple ransomware groups that target enterprises, creates a dual pressure to pay the ransom– not just to unlock their systems but also to avoid public distribution of their stolen data

The group has also adopted other double extortion approaches, such as DDoS attacks.

## Attacker’s motivations

LockBit is an opportunistic, financially motivated threat group. Its ideology is displayed as anti-capitalist.

During Russia's war in Ukraine in early 2022, the LockBit group remained neutral (unlike other threat groups who took sides in the conflict ) : “We are not state-sponsored and we are not in politics at all”, due to members being from around the globe, as stated by LockBit on February 27, 2022.

## Victimology

Overall, the LockBit ransomware impacts organizations in almost every vertical. It is used for big game hunting (BGH) ransomware campaigns aimed at high-value targets. However, the most recent recruitment campaign launched by the group provides detailed instructions on which verticals should be avoided or not by affiliates.

Overview of the LockBit group’s guidelines to its affiliates on the targeting of specific sectors, as announced while launching the new LockBit 3.0 affiliate program early July 2022


According to the statistics provided by SEKOIA.IO, a total of 761 victim companies were mentioned on the LockBit ransomware leak site between July 2021 (following the LockBit 2.0 release) and April 2022. Almost all of the victims are enterprise corporations. 

![](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v2/inthreat/images/f288862bc3a9c7f6f2db720a170273a1bf1641e6c6fa9f9cee31ed81758af50a.png)

LockBit 2.0 targets organizations opportunistically. Closely examining the affected organizations, we concluded that most of them are in the manufacturing or the financial industry.

## Dark Web activity

The LockBit group is known for offering LockBit as a ransomware as a service for a limited number of partners/affiliates on several Dark Web forums. In order to become an affiliate, one must have high skills, motivation, and good references who can verify the candidate. Affiliates are tasked with gaining initial access to the victim network, allowing LockBit 2.0 to conduct the rest of the attack.

The group' s members also benefit from their presence on Dark Web to promote their own exfiltration tool - StealBit, to collaborate with different IABs (Initial Access Brokers) and to regularly come up with inputs and statements on the latest developments in the cybercrime landscape.

The group's most prominent representative on cybercriminal forums is actually [LockBitSupp](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--63214ae7-8735-4c8c-a792-f5c3bb149c4c),  a very active Russian-speaking threat actor mostly operating on the XSS underground forum. \"LockBitSupp\" is steadily leveraging the increasing public interest in ransomware-related topics by offering interviews for both specialized and generalized media.

	stix:description """Sandworm is a well known Russian-speaking threat actor responsible for destabilization campaigns by doing sabotage and leaking operations against occidental interests. This intrusion set has been attributed by several intelligence agencies to Russia's **[General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--ca2f2a66-74c5-4c68-80a3-ec43478d8f50) Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST) military unit 74455**. 

According to open sources, **Sandworm has been active since at least 2008 when they had attempted Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS)** by using the first version of the [BackEnergy malware](/intelligence/objects/malware--52de4136-9d17-453a-aba5-0b6c681a671d) during the Russo-Georgian war. Following this first appearance on the international scene, Sandworm made the headlines in several international crises implicating Russia such as in Ukraine, following the Euromaidan crisis (2013) by doing several **sabotage campaigns against the Ukrainian government, media, transports and energy sector**. 

During the 2014-2022 cold confratation between Russian and Ukraine, Sandworm was also responsible for the creation of the [NotPetya worm](/intelligence/objects/malware--30a3a093-00e5-438f-a7ca-aa5d8ef92e03) that has been spread in hundreds of networks connected to Ukrainian entities. NotPetya, by mimicking ransomware, had sabotage capabilities **causing several billion dollars of damage for the infected companies**.

Sandworm is known to have been implicated in other crises such as the 2018 Winter Olympics destabilization attempt with the infamous [Olympic Destroyer](/intelligence/objects/malware--2fa4b91a-7684-494d-a0f6-71215867833e) malware or the Skripal case, by trying to **compromise physically the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons** and several laboratories working on this case (2018) via spear phishing campaigns. 

One of the most famous destabilization attempts done by the Sandworm intrusion set is the **French “Macron Leaks” (2017)** when the operators compromised several mailboxes of Macron staff members to leak their content to Wikileaks and on the /pol/ board of the (now defunct) 4Chan forum. This operation was a small part of a much wider spear phishing campaign targeting many sectors and individuals, related by Google TAG in 2020.

Even though Sandworm closely works with another GRU-linked intrusion set dubbed as [APT28](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--40479e35-a7ca-4c05-998d-2cf21ab751cc), their operators employ different TTPs. **Sandworm is more flexible and seems dedicated to special destabilization operations involving a smaller footprint in the targeted entities**. 

**Sandworm is largely active since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war**, conducting campaigns for **intelligence collection**, **multiple destructive network attacks**, contributing to **information operations**, and even, according to Google, using “hack-for-hire” services to secure initial access to some targets. 
Sandworn levareged multiple **straightforward** and **ready-to-use wipers** (HermeticWiper, AcidRain, Industroyer2, ZeroWipe, SwiftSlicer...) looking to [contribute](https://blog.sekoia.io/one-year-after-the-cyber-implications-of-the-russo-ukrainian-war/) to Russian intelligence to work faster, looking for more immediate effects  rather than complex and long-term planned destructive worms. 

# TTPs

One of the main characteristics of this intrusion set is to **use mostly open source tools for initial access ([Empire](/intelligence/objects/malware--43650dc8-980b-4b5f-9646-476cccbae2f7), [Meterpreter](/intelligence/objects/tool--38d6ece7-4244-4dcd-a4fe-5c150c561b8b), remote administration tools)** and **tailored and destructive malware to achieve their operations** such as [Industroyer](/intelligence/objects/malware--b0fab28c-b86a-4140-946e-0bd2a26e191c), [BadRabbit](/intelligence/objects/malware--461ca82d-640f-43b5-911a-97763e400899), NotPetya or even Olympic Destroyer. Sandworm intrusion set proven to master all of intrusion vectors from spear phishing to watering holes, frontal compromise and supply chain attacks. Moreover, they showed **their ability to develop their own modular implants for SOHO routers such as [VPN Filter](/intelligence/objects/malware--d9e9a85d-dbd9-471c-bb39-c70d122ada7f) and [Cyclops Blink](/intelligence/objects/malware--a76416d2-0551-4843-8c9f-fdf930a168e9) to constitute their own botnet**. 

Regarding its infrastructure, Sandworm is using compromised websites and VPS servers. **The use of domain names by this intrusion set is very rare** and they rely mostly on IPv4 addresses in their malware configuration. Historically, they also set up TOR relays on their C2s. **This use of TOR relays can be related to an attempt to prevent SIGINT interception**.

Since 2018, the Sandworm intrusion set operators have been subject to different lawsuits and public shaming from occidental authorities. In 2018, four sandworm operators were caught by the General Intelligence and Security Service of the Netherlands (AIVD) during a close access operation against the OPCW network. Following this raid, the identities of the GRU members and their attack methods were disclosed to the public.

In October 2020, the US Department of Justice indicted six other operators working for the Sandworm instruction set. These GRU Unit 74455 officers were indicted for several cyber operations such as NotPetya attack, the Macron Leaks, Olympic Destroyer or the operation against the OPCW network. Some of these attacks were conducted with the assistance of GRU Unit 26165, which is also dubbed as APT28. 

### 2022-2023 Russia-Ukraine war activity

Despite the public shaming and the indictments, and after a quiet period in 2021, Sandworm came back to the stage with the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, with multiple compromise and sabotage operations targeting Ukrainian and occidental entities (mainly coutries supporting Kiev)

Sandworm was observed by many cybersecurity vendors using several kind of wipers impacting Ukraine entities.
* [Acid Rain wiper](/intelligence/objects/malware--0a2df090-4065-4a9d-a21e-84b6f0e9694d), used in the VIA-SAT operation impacting satellite communication
* [CaddyWiper](/intelligence/objects/malware--ab89b963-512f-41ca-be8b-3f77c0de651b) (used by APT28 as well), alongside Ar[guepatch d](/intelligence/objects/malware--b2016a76-1eaa-4367-808a-7cc2f4eb36cd)ropper
* [Prestige Ransomware](/intelligence/objects/malware--7114b03e-ec78-4820-9009-7af893930a6c), used as a wiper to target transportation and logistics industries in Ukraine and Poland.
* [AWFULSHRED](/intelligence/objects/malware--52eaa90b-aa36-4e09-bd6c-216d9b3ed463), used in a desctrutive operation impactive the Ukrainian Press Agency.
* [ZeroWipe](/intelligence/objects/malware--30b81fbb-0109-4439-93e8-1d6d8a4dd502), used in a destructive operation impactive the Ukrainian Press Agency.
* [SwiftSlicer](/intelligence/objects/malware--a04a6636-61b7-4390-8671-108937b74b8e)

* Preserving the **existence** and **legitimacy** of the Communist Party of China (**CPC**).

* Protecting China’s **national interest security**, including its **territorial integrity**

* Asserting **China’s power globally**, including in the cyber domain.

Cyber is also used as a force multiplier in the land, air, sea and space domains.
<br>

These strategic interests are operationalized through:

**Economic coercion** of neighbours and partners, notably through cyberespionage

Leverage of a **wide array of instruments of national power**, including intelligence and cyber capabilities

Influencing international **standards and policy making related to cyber**
<br>

Since at least **2006** China leveraged cyber capabilities to support these objectives. In 2013, Mandiant (FireEye) published their first report related to APT1 aka Comment Crew, one of the first documented China-nexus Intrusion Set. Since then, cyber threats aligning on China’s interests were continuously reported on, with observed **maturing in capabilities and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)**, as well as changes in its underlying organisation and doctrine.
This aims at contouring the Chinese cyber threat for awareness and anticipation purposes. It must be noted that, as it is based on open source, sometimes contradictory information or intelligence gaps remain. Hence, it should be regarded as a snapshot of SEKOIA’s vision of the matter at hand at the time of writing.

# Doctrine & Organisation

Key drivers of Chinese offensive cyber doctrine revolve around territorial integrity and internal stability, and expansion and maintenance of regional and global influence. Cyber operations associated with China include industrial espionage to sustain economic objectives linked to self-reliance, intelligence collection pertaining to geopolitical and foreign policy disputes, and domestic operations to preserve the power of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with an emphasis on CPC narrative control, information monitoring and surveillance.


China is actively reforming its national security apparatus including its civilian and military intelligence agencies which notably use cyber capabilities, both separately and jointly, to carry out cyber malicious activities. Most prominent agencies include the Ministry of State Security [MSS](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--d90d1397-46df-46ba-bcbe-93ddd9b053a0) and the People Liberation Army Strategic Support Force [PLASSF](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--70b6e373-0e99-46f1-8c80-b333a9896078), reorganised between 2017 and 2020. SEKOIA’s representation of the Chinese cyber offensive apparatus is as follow:


![](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v2/inthreat/images/44c4ef154813b5f4bb910825fccd78b5456f6d6f6e9d529affc21d07525e0863.png)

<br>

Several indictments report that both agencies use “proxies”, such as information and technology companies and universities to conduct their cyber operations. Since the 1920s, the CPC also developed a strategic concept known as “United Front”, a network of social, professional, political and academic organisations, to support the CPC’s interests and suspected to be involved in supporting Chinese intelligence activities, including cyber.
This results in a vast number of stakeholders disconnecting China from malicious cyber operations, providing the State with *plausible deniability*, and further complexifying the threat landscape.
<br>
Since 2020, observed Chinese cyber espionage campaigns exhibited an increased risk tolerance in Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) as well as increased activities’ tempo, echoing the country's wolf warrior diplomacy.
<br>
Domestically, China’s approach to cyberspace is driven by a technological imperative of self-reliance and ensuring long-term innovation-led growth, and a political drive of controlling the flow of information within cyberspace to safeguard regime legitimacy and social stability. The latter is notably reflected through China’s engagement in global cyber initiatives and its promotion of *cyber sovereignty*, a principle also emphasised by Russia, considered a key strategic partner by China.

# Targeting

<br>
Cyber operations associated with China include industrial espionage to sustain economic objectives linked to self-reliance, intelligence collection pertaining to geopolitical and foreign policy disputes, and domestic operations to preserve the power of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with an emphasis on CPC narrative control, information monitoring and surveillance. China-nexus Intrusion Sets notably conduct upstream collection campaigns through Managed Services Providers (MSP) and supply chain compromises to collect large amounts of data such as Personal Identifiable Information (PII). SEKOIA assess exfiltrated data is highly likely leveraged in follow-on cyber campaigns as well as HUMINT operations. Of note, information operations and surveillance campaigns are also achieved through legal means, such as the Cyber Security Law (CSL) enforced in 2017, and infrastructures such as the Great Firewall (GFW).
 <br>
 
# Chinese reported cyber activities

<br> 

**1.  Cyber espionage**

<br>

* Industrial espionage

Chinese cyber espionage operations present a continuous threat to intellectual property. Observed campaigns carried out by suspected China-nexus threat actors in the past notably targeted Western technologies such as high-tech, oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, energy, aviation, aerospace, defence industrial bases, dual-use military application technologies, and telecommunications. While geographical distribution of China-nexus cyber campaigns victimology indicates a primary focus on Asia Pacific (APAC) region and North-America, China-nexus intrusion sets also targeted countries across the globe, including France, as well as countries and regions involved in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Those are assessed to enable Chinese indigenous production and support Chinese industrial policies, such as the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). It is also assessed that strategic information collected through cyber espionage are likely [passed on to China champions](https://medium.com/cycraft/taiwan-high-tech-ecosystem-targeted-by-foreign-apt-group-5473d2ad8730) for commercial competition on international markets as well as gaining strategic know-how.


* Strategic intelligence collection

China continuously demonstrates efforts to increase its international influence and role as a major [regional power](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-cyber-idUSKBN1L00X8), notably through territorial disputes and government programs and plans such as the BRI and Made in China 2025 (MIC2025). China’s political priority is to maintain territorial integrity, including over disputed land and maritime regions or *de facto* independent provinces. Examples of this driver include the regions of Hong Kong and Taiwan, disputed land ownership on the Sino-Indian border in Kashmir, and maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea.


* Surveillance


Domestically, China-nexus Intrusion Sets carried out multiple surveillance campaigns against what is called “the Five poisons”, including Taiwan independence movement, the Tibetan Independence movement, the [Uygur ethnic group](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/05/27/minority-report-fake-human-rights-documents-and-websites-used-in-cyberattacks-targeting-uyghurs-a-turkic-ethnic-minority-in-china/), the Chinese democratic movement and the Falun Gong. Abroad,  surveillance operations target the Chinese diaspora, including Chinese citizens, dissident groups, and members of China’s ethnic minority communities. 


**2.  Military cyber activities**


In relation to military cyber operations, PLA publications indicate that improving computer network exploitation and attack capabilities in order to degrade adversaries’ networks and information environments is seen as critical to winning future wars. Recent open source publications notably report on increased [targeting of Critical National Infrastructures by China-nexus Intrusion Sets](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/attacks-on-industrial-control-systems-using-shadowpad/). It is assessed that the latest intelligence services reorganisation is likely to redistribute mandates, with the PLA focusing on operational environment preparedness, including cyber-enabled related activities.


**3. Info Ops**


[China information operations](https://www.irsem.fr/rapport.html) pose a high-volume threat globally. Initially focusing on regional targets and matters, it sensibly expanded to Western countries in 2020. Observed campaigns  used a wide range of social media platforms and websites, and were two-folded – containing or censuring negative comments towards China and the CPC, and conveying negative narratives against European countries, the U.S or any country considered as hostile. Targeted audiences include the Chinese diaspora as well as international media, economy and politics stakeholders. It is almost certain that topics such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the exactions on the Uygur community led China to intensify its efforts in increasing its information operations.

# China-nexus Intrusion Sets

<br>

Reflecting involved stakeholders in the Chinese cyber offensive apparatus, China-nexus Intrusion Set landscape is heterogeneous and opaquely state-linked, characterised by dynamic and evolving relationships between threat actors and state bodies across spectrums of direct government sponsorship and independent moonlighting activities. Additionally, it is suspected that these IS would resort to quartermasters (i.e. mutualized malware developers, possibly initial access brokers) which further blurs the lines. While this has a limited impact for detection, this hinders Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) efforts.

<br>

China-nexus Intrusion Sets leverage malware originating from China's hacking community, commodity malware, customised or repurposed tools, and zero-day software vulnerabilities. Open sources indicate that through steady investment in developing custom malware for privilege escalation, lateral movement and network reconnaissance, as well as improvements in command-and-control infrastructure, Chinese-linked intrusion sets departed from historically less advanced and \"noisy\" behaviour to becoming stealthier and more persistent. MSS-linked cyber espionage operators notably secured persistent access to victim organisations through compromises in third-party trusted supply chains and leveraging stealthy living-off-the-land initial infection vectors. Recently, China-nexus Intrusion Sets were observed leveraging ransomware in false flag cyberespionage campaigns.
<br>
Recently active China-nexus groups include APT4, APT10, APT25, APT27, APT31, APT40, APT41, Chromium, Naikon, and Mustang Panda.

	stix:description """**SUMMARY**

Russian intelligence is mostly divided into three main agencies that all have units that deploy cyber operations: The **[Main Directorate of the General Staff](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--ca2f2a66-74c5-4c68-80a3-ec43478d8f50)** (**GRU**) of the Armed Forces , the military intelligence agency; the **[Federal Security Service](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--9593a575-566d-4f58-96a0-45c95356d511)** (**FSB**) which is the continuation of ex-soviet KGB, in charge of internal security, counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism, and surveillance; the **[Foreign Intelligence Service](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--de741e1a-061d-449f-a7d8-8d8aee0069b1)** (**SVR**), Russia's external intelligence agency, focusing mainly on foreign politics and diplomacy.

There is a strong competition between those three agencies due to the overlap of their perimeters, where the FSB works as well on military intelligence and GRU being the actual main service for foreign intelligence to support foreign policy objectives.

Russian intelligence services have **extensive experience** in **conducting psychological and information operations** inherited from Soviet-era propaganda. Russian intelligence doctrine now includes **a new view of warfare** where the line between peace and conflict is blurred, and where **cyber operations** can be used as an **effective and relatively cheap tool** to undermine, subvert, and manipulate an adversary. 

Russian intelligence is well known for **interfering in elections of foreign countries** in order to manipulate domestic audiences and **undermine the faith in democratic systems**. Instead of seeking a particular outcome (as it was assumed for the 2016 US presidential elections), the goal for Russian information operations is more on causing chaos and weakening the domestic legitimacy of an adversary’s government.

If all those **three agencies** conduct cyber operations to **collect intelligence** with a high technical level, **slightly different modus operandi can be noted**. GRU operations include **destructive** or “hack-and-leak” operations when the FSB is also a **point of contact** for Russian-aligned cybercrime groups. The SVR is known to operate with a high degree of discretion, seeking to gain and retain access and **trying to avoid detection**. 

![](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v2/inthreat/images/b9645ad13412fcb8701240fda9844c6ef9f99bdbebd8486d0555fb9b1b36c92f.png)

**HISTORY**

Russian intelligence services have a complex relationship with the soviet era KGB, which is important to know in order to understand the roles, objectives and means of the offensive cyber operations conducted by Moscow.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Boris Eltsine, the first president of the Russian Federation, wanted to reform the intelligence services, principally the KGB which was the symbol of the ex-totalitarian regime's dirty work. Especially after the failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt, conducted by hardliner communist including the head of KGB Vladimir Krioutchkov, Eltsine wanted to gain more control over this institution.

In order to simulate concurrency and efficiency among new intelligence agencies, but also to have a better democratic control over them, **Boris Eltsine decided to split the KGB**, in two agencies, the FSB and the SVR. The KGB’s first directorate for foreign intelligence (PGU) functions were transferred to the SVR in 1991, and the second directorate (VGU), in charge of counter-espionage, was transferred to the FSB.

Even if both agencies are issued from KGB, in terms of human resources the **FSB can be considered as the true heir of the soviet agency** (~150,000 employees work for the FSB, 15,000 for the SVR). Moreover, the FSB kept the ancient headquarters of the KGB in Loubianka place in Moscow. The FSB was also charged with the protection of Russian economic interests in the 90s.

In the meanwhile, **Elstine preserved the name, budget and organization of the GRU**. To him, the institution was more legitimate than the KGB, less steeped by communist ideology and barely known for human right violations. The GRU intelligence agency was supposed to report only to the Ministry of Defence, and thus was presumed to be more pragmatic than political. Many foreign intelligence positions left vacant were given to GRU military officers.

	stix:description """North Korea (aka DPRK for Democratic People's Republic of Korea) was observed conducting cyber offensive activities **since at least 2004**. Called the \"secret war\" by Pyongyang, there is no open source document pertaining to North Korea cyber doctrine to date. DPRK offensive cyber doctrine, associated with the development of a ballistic, nuclear, and bacteriological arsenal, is a force multiplier, notably in subverting international sanctions and funding Pyongyang’s economy.

DPRK cyber malicious activities include **cyberespionage** operations, **lucrative** campaigns and **destructive** and **disruptive** attacks. Of note, no destructive attack was associated to DPRK since 2015, and the last disruptive attack attributed to Pyongyang dates back from 2017 (WannaCry).

DPRK strategic objectives pertain to the **survival of the North Korean state**, as well as **maintaining its position within the international system** as a “small great power.” To that purpose, DPRK-associated Intrusion Sets were seen conducting cyberespionage campaigns, notably against defense and security-related entities, entities and individuals involved in nuclear policy amd military matters, and international organisations, to collect strategic and military intelligence. Lucrative campaigns associated to the DPRK were observed targeting banks, cryptoassets users and platforms (including cryptocurrency exchange and mixers) as well as the financial technology sector. Additional targets of interest to the DPRK are Korean Peninsula-related NGOs and enties.

DPRK malicious cyber activities involve multiple state organisations, including the Ministry of State Security ( MSS aka Bowibu) and the Reconnaissance General Bureau (known as RGB). Associated DPRK Intrusion Sets include [Lazarus](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--2c618d0f-c909-4400-9783-668ce297124f), [Bluenoroff](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--a71b9f4f-4ace-4d82-bd84-fb9599e57a26), [Andariel](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--f410b643-65c3-47e7-8cf9-76d06c7f5775), [Reaper](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--234dd351-8674-4553-934c-76cbf5efc0cb), and [Kimsuky](intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--baf76692-a00e-4c2a-85fd-da17438b08a7).

Contrary to other states, **Iran does not present a public cyber strategy**. However, the observed use of its capabilities shows a rational use of this tool, following **three goals**. 

First in domestic policy, Iran uses cyber operations to ensure the **stability** and **maintenance of the regime** by monitoring political dissidents, journalists and activists seen as vectors of foreign influence. Secondly, Tehran operates cyber groups to **protect national territory** perceived as militarily threatened by enemies (USA, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia and some European countries). Thus, cyber operations focus on **espionage** and **intelligence gathering about adversary intentions**. And last, in foreign policy, Iran operates cyber operations as a **power-projection tool** to promote and secure its regional ambitions (Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Israel, Yemen). 

Since 2018, Iran-linked APTs are considered a **serious threat**, reaching **operational and technical maturity**. Iran uses its cyber capabilities to target mainly its regional and strategic adversaries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE, the US but doesn’t seem to directly target French interests as priority.

The **main difference** between **IRGC** and **MOIS** is their staff recruitment - IRGC recruits more ideology-driven staff than MOIS - and their **direct affiliation into the iranian regime**. IRGC is under the direct control of the Supreme Leader when MOIS answers to the Presidency. From 2013 to 2021, the election and mandate of moderate president Rouhani made MOIS cyber operations more covert and less destructive, in order to comply with its appeasement policy with the West. At the same time IRGC leaders were opposed to such a strategy and were deploying aggressive cyber operations towards perceived threats. Since the **election of conservative Raissi** as president in 2021, the Supreme Leader and the presidency share the same strategy. SEKOIA assesses that **MOIS** and **IRGC APTs** will thus **converge** on the **same** **operational use** of cyber offensive capabilities.

In Iran, academic institutions, such as **Imam Hossein University** and **Shadid Beheshti University** are assisting the Iranian cyber program by enhancing the technical capabilities of intelligence operators and by conducting operations as proxy. 

**Private companies** (Mabna Institute, Rana Company, …) are also often **contracted** **by intelligence** or military entities to conduct cyber operations, sometimes with the technical collaboration or with a shared attack infrastructure furnished by the contractors. This proxy use complicates efforts to assess attribution.

**IRAN CYBER THREAT EVOLUTION**

Iranian cyber threat is known to evolve quickly, as much for its technical and operational capabilities. In 2020, open-source publications showed that Iran-linked APT are now deploying more and more ransomware operations, using cybercrime techniques in order to both finance private proxy groups and state treasury, disrupt their target, and complicate efforts to assess attribution.

Iran APTs are also more patient and persistent while engaging with their targets, but still continue to employ aggressive brute force attacks on some targets.

**HISTORY**

For a better comprehension and understanding of Iranian cyber operations, an **historical approach** is important to assess how cyber was fully integrated into state services.

Iran's cyberspace approach has evolved since **2010** and the alleged **origin of cyber use** for Iranian state. Formerly used as an internal tool for information control and regime stability, it has evolved to an open use to conduct espionage, destructives attacks and lucrative operations on foreign targets.

The origin of Iranian cyber operations as a power tool has **two origins** : the **2009 Green Movement** where civilians protested against the reelection of Ahmadinedjad, former conservative president ; and the **discovery of 2010 STUXNET**, allegedly developed by US and Israeli services to damage nuclear centrifuge machines. Iranian leaders then understood the necessity of domestic internet and social media control in order to maintain the stability of the regime, and the **potential for cyber operations**, as a target and as an attacker. Iran created a Supreme Council of Cyberspace shortly after, in 2012.

In august 2012, Iran has put its new cyber policy into action by deploying its **first wiper** malware dubbed \"**Shamoon**\" against Saudi Arabia’s oil company **Aramco**, causing significant industrial damage.

Since 2012, Iran cyber capabilities have **increased every year** in **technical** and **operational skills**. Tehran operates its cyber operations with an asymmetrical approach. Rather than trying to reach highly technical attacks, Iran conducts DDoS, defacement, deception, sabotage and espionage operations, through intermediate technical sophistication. Iran's asymmetrical tactic **targets** in particular **industrial** and **financial entities** to maximize economic damage and media coverage. 

Since 2020, according to US intelligence services, Iran has the ability to conduct **attacks on critical infrastructure**, as well as to conduct influence and espionage activities.

This worm had the particularity to embed three different vectors to spread inside the compromised networks such as using PSExec, WMI and via the EternalBlue - previously leaked - NSA exploit targeting the MS17-010. NotPetya also embedded some snippets from the Mimikatz project in its resource section to grab passwords from infected computers' lsass memory. 

Once executed, NotPetya disables the events logging, infects the Master Boot Record to print a decoy message pretending that is a ransomware and implements a flawed file system encryption component using AES128-CBC and RSA, preventing the victim from recovering the encrypted files. Then the worm restart the compromised workstation by creating a scheduled task which executes the shutdown executable one hour after the initial infection or use the NtRaiseHardError native API call to reboot the machine.

	stix:description """## Resume
Initially reported in June 2022 on a security forum by alleged victims, the first public case of PLAY Ransomware was announced when a journalist uncovered that Argentina’s Judiciary of Córdoba was victimized.

Play is a heavily obfuscated ransomware which appends the file extension \".play\" to encrypted files and drops the ransom note into the drive folder only.

As reported in September 2022 by TrendMicro, the [Play operators](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--d82d2e1e-791b-4aef-bfb9-4f54b6735de5) use many tactics that follow the playbook of both Hive and Nokoyawa ransomware, thus there is a high probability of affiliation between these ransomware families. TrendMicro also found evidence that points to a possible connection between Play ransomware and Quantum ransomware.

## Signs of infection
**Ransom note**: `ReadMe.txt`
**Encrypted files extension** : `.play`

## Analysis
The Play ransomware implements multiple capabilities, including:
* Anti-analysis;
* Encryption;
* DLL injfection;
* Execution on network.

The Play ransomware can run with or withouth command-line arguments.

### Anti-analysis Features
According to Chuongdong in-depth analysis, the Play ransomware :
* is able to bypass most static analysis through IDA’s disassembly and decompilation;
* obfuscates its code by littering its code with random moving instructions;
* implements API name hashing (the API resolving function takes in a target hash and a DLL address);
* encrypts its strings.

### Encryption Routine
Before iterating through all drives to encrypt, Play enumerates all volumes on the victim’s system.

The ransomware uses a depth-first traversal algorithm to iterate through the file system.

If a file extension matches one of the following list, it doesn't encrypt the file: `.exe, .dll, .lnk, .sys, readme.txt, bootmgr, .msi, .PLAY, ReadMe.txt`. It does not encrypt file if its size is less than 6.

The Play ransomware avoids encrypting the \"WIndows\" repository.

The malware uses the generic RSA-AES hybrid-cryptosystem to encrypt files.""" ;

* Runs every 60 seconds, encrypting all files except those critical to the functionality of the victim’s machine and those that have the designated encrypted file extension. 
* Establishes persistence by copying an executable (svhost.exe or svhostt.exe) to the %APPDATA%\\Roaming directory and scheduling a task to run the ransomware every 15 minutes. 
* Attempts to prevent standard recovery techniques by deleting local backups, disabling startup recovery options, and deleting shadow copies [T1490].

	stix:description """BlackEnergy is a malware that was created by a Russian developer named Dmytro Oleksiuk and also known as Cr4sh. The first version of Black Energy was a pretty straightforward DDoS bot with only simple commands. According to a blogpost from Cr4sh, he sold the source code of Black Energy on underground forums for $700 in 2007. In mid-2008 the Sandworm intrusion set made significant modifications to the original version, creating a new modular version of the bot called by the industry “Black Energy 2”.

Unlike the first version, the second version of BlackEnergy was more complex, obfuscated and used process-injection techniques. It allowed the operators to retrieve and execute plugins from the C2 servers. Several plugins mostly related to DDoS actions were developed. In addition to plugins, backenergy can act also as a standalone backdoor with a small set of standard commands such as:

* `rexec` download and execute a remote file;
* `lexec` – execute a local file on the infected computer;
* `die` – terminate bot execution;
* `upd` – update the bot;
* `setfreq` – set the beaconing frequency;
* `http` – send an HTTP request to the specified web page.


It's in 2014 that specific plugins, developed to interact with ICS systems or to destroy computers, were developed and used against occidental and Ukrainian targets. The use of BackEnergy by Sandworm gave the name of BackEnergy to this intrusion set by the editor. Finally, several plugins were developed by the sandworm intrusion set such as (List from Wikipedia) :
 
* fs.dll — File system operations
* si.dll — System information, “BlackEnergy Lite”
* jn.dll — Parasitic infector
* ki.dll — Keylogger
* ps.dll — Password stealer
* ss.dll — Screenshots
* vs.dll — Network discovery, remote execution
* tv.dll — Team viewer
* rd.dll — Simple pseudo “remote desktop”
* up.dll — Update malware
* dc.dll — List Windows accounts
* bs.dll — Query system hardware, BIOS, and Windows info
* dstr.dll — Destroy system
* scan.dll — Network scan

Sandworm seems to have stopped the use of BackEnergy during its campaign since at least 2015. BackEnergy was replaced by several backdoor and tailored implants for specific tasks such as Industroyer or Kill Disk.""" ;

First seen in August 2022, Lumma is an information stealer written in C using WinApi functions. In late 2022 a new version (LummaC2) was released on underground forums. Lumma is sold and distributed as a Malware-as-a-Service. According to the [threat actor advertising the LummaC2 on cybercrime forums](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--af95847c-0de9-4f76-8007-986f0cc56a70), it is forbidden the stealer is not distrbuted in Russia and Belarus.

Lumma's capabilities are those of a classic stealer, with a focus on cryptocurrency wallets. Here are the main capabilities:
* Targeting of browsers (to steal passwords, cookies, autofills and credit cards);
* Targeting of Desktop cryptocurrency wallets and extension for cryptocurrency wallets (Exodus, Binance, Electrum, Electrum LTC, Etherum, Jaxx, ElectronCash);
* Listing running processes.

As Mars Stealer and Vidar do, Lumma downloads legitimate third-party libraries for data collection into compromised hosts (`sqlite3.dll`, `nss3.dll`, `mozglue.dll`, `freebl3.dll` and `softokn3.dll`).

Lumma is sold as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) by LummaC on Russian-speaking underground forums (such as XSS and RAMP) and Telegram.

One of its alleged developpers is [c0d3r_0f_shr0d13ng3r](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--e99c4590-751b-4b09-ab2d-3c06547806d9), a possible contributor for the LummaC project, advertised by the [Shamel](/intelligence/objects/threat-actor--af95847c-0de9-4f76-8007-986f0cc56a70) threat actor.

## Analysis

_The following technical analysis is based on the sample `7873dddec4a46e7ad104de9b6bd68f590575b7680a1d20b9fe1329d1ad95348f`, first seen in the wild on August 11, 2022, which would correspond to a version under development._

### Step-by-step execution

Here is an overview of the step-by-step execution of the Lumma stealer:
1. The malware sends the string `ct_start` using an HTTP POST request (URI /windbg) to its C2 server, probably to initiate the communication.
2. It then sends the string `chr_start` using an HTTP POST request (URI /windbg) to its C2 server, before downloading the legitimate third-party DLL `sqlite3.dll` by sending an HTTP GET request to `/lib/sqlite3.dll`.
3. Lumma then sends the string `moz_start` using an HTTP POST request (URI /windbg) to its C2 server, before downloading the other legitimate third-party DLLs `nss3.dll`, `mozglue.dll`, `freebl3.dll` and `softokn3.dll`.
4. Once DDLs are downloaded, the malware sends the string `grb_start` using an HTTP POST request (URI /windbg) to its C2 server to indicate it will start to grab information.
5. It then collects data from web browsers and Desktop crypto wallets, lists the running processes on the infected host.
6. Collected data is stored in `ProgramData\\config.txt` and then compressed in a zip file named `winrarupd.zip`.
7. It sends the string `upl_start` to its C2 server, again HTTP POST request on /windb, to indicate it will start to upload data.
8. The malware then exfiltrates the archive to the C2 server using a HTTP POST request (URI /winsock).

The malware updated its capabilities since version 4.0:
- **Control Flow Flattening** (CFF) obfuscation implemented
- New **Anti-Sandbox** technique to delay detonation of the sample until **human mouse** activity is detected.
-  **Strings** are now **XOR** obfuscated instead of simply modified by adding junk strings in the middle.
- Supports dynamic configuration files retrieved from the C2, where the configuration is **Base64** encoded and **XORed** with the first 32 bytes of the configuration file.

The developer enforces threat actors to use a crypter for their builds.

Side note about the CFF: Lumma changed it CFF technique regulary in the different versions. The control flow is modified by a sort of large state machine where in some version the state are constante and in newer version they are pushed on the stack.

## Tracking the C2 infrastructure

_The following content is from September 2023 and is taken from the report [FLINT 2023-033 - Tracking the C2 infrastructures of the prevalent infostealer families](/intelligence/objects/report--1b3f4bf9-e607-48ca-a7a6-f0abb972aba2). The heuristics mentioned may change over time._

### URL-based heuristic

Lumma samples communicate with their C2 domains using HTTP to:
* Register on its C2 server using a GET request to the root “/”;
* Retrieve its encrypted configuration from its C2 server using a POST request to “/c2conf”;
* Exfiltrate harvested data using POST requests to “/c2sock”.

A basic heuristic based on the URL pattern stems from the Lumma C2 communications. Sekoia.io analysts use a query similar to the following on urlscan:
* [`filename:( \"c2sock\" OR \"c2conf\") page.status:200`](https://urlscan.io/search/#filename%3A(%20%22c2sock%22%20OR%20%22c2conf%22)%20page.status%3A200)

### Cloudflare DNS records

Lumma’s C2 domains are hosted by Cloudflare since the end of June 2023. By correlating the DNS NS records, the SSL issuers, registrar information and the top-level domains (TLDs), we retrieved over 200 domains associated with Lumma C2 servers.

For all domains, URLs to the root return a characteristic HTML web page containing Russian text. By pivoting on the HTML content, we found the possible C2 servers using the following query on Shodan. They are highly likely behind the Cloudflare-protected domains:

* [`http.title:\"Есенин\" http.html:\"Ты меня не любишь\"`](https://beta.shodan.io/search?query=http.title%3A%22%D0%95%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%22+http.html%3A%22%D0%A2%D1%8B+%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F+%D0%BD%D0%B5+%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%88%D1%8C%22)

	stix:description """### Summary
Prestige is a ransomware identified by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) in October 2022.

Prestige targeted organizations in the transportation and related logistics industries in Ukraine and Poland since October 11, 2022, using a previously unidentified ransomware payload. The Prestige ransomware had not been observed by Microsoft prior to this deployment on this date. MSTIC has not yet linked this ransomware campaign to a known threat group.

This ransomware labels itself in its ransom note as “Prestige ranusomeware”.

### Malware analysis
The “Prestige” ransomware requires administrative privileges to run. Like many ransomware payloads, it attempts to stop the MSSQL Windows service to ensure successful encryption using the following command (the strings “C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe stop” and “MSSQLSERVER” are both hardcoded in the samples analyzed by Microsoft): `C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe stop MSSQLSERVER`

Prestige creates C:\\Users\\Public\\README and stores the following ransom note in the file. The same file is also created in the root directory of each drive: 
![](https://app.sekoia.io/api/v2/inthreat/images/aea190b3cb4c533a8ebd518942b03ebe3041f3b6909b5439ba96665e05174547.png)

Prestige then traverses the files on the file system and encrypts the contents of files that have specific hardcoded file extensions, avoiding encrypting files in the C:\\Windows\\ and C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\ directories. 

After encrypting each file, the ransomware appends the extension .enc to the existing extension of the file.""" ;

	stix:description """## Summary
LockBit ransomware is one of the most active families in the wild and pretends to implement the fastest encryption algorithms using multithreading with I/O completion ports. LockBit will automatically vet for valuable targets, spread the infection, and encrypt all accessible computer systems on a network. This ransomware is used for highly targeted attacks against enterprises and other organizations. 

LockBit ransomware is considered by many authorities to be part of the “LockerGoga & MegaCortex” malware family. This simply means that it shares behaviors with these established forms of targeted ransomware. As a quick explanation, we understand that these attacks are:
* Self-spreading within an organization rather than requiring manual direction.
* Targeted rather than spread in a scattershot fashion like spam malware.
* Using similar tools to spread, like Windows Powershell and Server Message Block (SMB).

# Technical details
## LockBit 1.0

Most significant is its ability to self-propagate, meaning it spreads on its own. In its programming, LockBit is directed by pre-designed automated processes. This makes it unique from many other ransomware attacks that are driven by manually living in the network — sometimes for weeks — to complete recon and surveillance.

After the attacker has manually infected a single host, it can find other accessible hosts, connect them to infected ones, and share the infection using a script. This is completed and repeated entirely without human intervention.

Furthermore, it uses tools in patterns that are native to nearly all Windows computer systems. Endpoint security systems have a hard time flagging malicious activity. It also hides the executable encrypting file by disguising it as the common .PNG image file format, further deceiving system defenses.

## LockBit 2.0
In July 2021, researchers discovered an analyzed new LockBit samples. Ransomware developpers added a new feature to automatize the process illustrated in _LockBit 1.0_ that consists in deploying scripts that disable antivirus and execute the ransomware on the machines on the network. Now, the ransomware creates new group policies on the domain controller that are then pushed out to every device on a domain controller.

At execution, if privileges are not sufficient, it attempts to escalate to the required privileges. Lockbit 2.0 then determines the system and  user language settings and only targets those not matching a set list of languages that are Eastern European. If an Eastern European language is detected, the program exits without infection.

The ransomware will also use Windows Active Directory APIs to perform LDAP queries against the domain controller's ADS to get a list of computers.

According to Sophos, Lockbit 2.0 and LockFile are similar in at least two ways: the HTA ransom note and the partial encryption.

LockBit 2.0 also contains a self-spreading feature, clears logs and can print the ransom note on network printers until the paper runs out.

## LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker version 1.0

Since October 2021, a Linux variant of LockBit was observed. It seems to be specifically created to lock ESXi servers.
This version of the ransomware has logging capabilities and can log the following information:
* Processor information
* Volumes in the system
* Virtual machines (VMs) for skipping
* Total files
* Total VMs
* Encrypted files
* Encrypted VMs
* Total encrypted size
* Time spent for encryption

## LockBit 3.0 aka LockBit Black
On March 17, 2022, Lockbit ransomware members announced on underground forums they intend to release LockBit 3.0. This new, upgraded version of the malware has already been spotted in malicious campaigns by May 2022 and would be called Lockbit Black by the group itself.

**The LockBit 3.0 version has some code similarities with samples related to the BlackMatter ransomware**. It appears that the code in charge of loading its required functions for both LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter uses API hashing technique with the same hashing algorithm (ror13_add). The algorithm used to import the functions by their hashes is the same for LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter (ror13_add, but with different XOR keys), the hashing algorithm used for the module name is add_ror13. Moreover, both ransomware attempt to hide the main thread from the debugger.

These similarities would raise concerns about a possible link between the gangs behind LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter. Whether the link between the two groups is formal or casual, the code similarities between LockBit 3.0 and BlackMatter are providing additional weight to the hypothesis that different ransomware groups, particularly those of Russian origin, are increasingly interconnected.

-------------------

If a LockBit affiliate does not have access to passwordless LockBit 3.0 ransomware, then a password argument is mandatory during the execution of the ransomware. LockBit 3.0 affiliates failing to enter the correct password will be unable to execute the ransomware. 
The password is a cryptographic key which decodes the LockBit 3.0 executable. By protecting the code in such a manner, LockBit 3.0 hinders malware detection and analysis with the code being unexecutable and unreadable in its encrypted form. 
Signature-based detections may fail to detect the LockBit 3.0 executable as the executable’s encrypted potion will vary based on the cryptographic key used for encryption while also generating a unique hash. When provided the correct password, LockBit 3.0 will decrypt the main component, continue to decrypt or decompress its code, and execute the ransomware.

LockBit 3.0 will only infect machines that do not have language settings matching a defined exclusion list. However, whether a system language is checked at runtime is determined by a configuration flag originally set at compilation time. Languages on the exclusion list include, but are not limited to, Romanian (Moldova), Arabic (Syria), and Tatar (Russia). If a language from the exclusion list is detected, LockBit 3.0 will stop execution without infecting the system.

LockBit 3.0 attempts to spread across a victim network by using a preconfigured list of credentials hardcoded at compilation time or a compromised local account with elevated privileges.
When compiled, LockBit 3.0 may also enable options for spreading via Group Policy Objects and PsExec using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. LockBit 3.0 attempts to encrypt data saved to any local or remote device, but skips files associated with core system functions

**LockBit ransomware builder leaked online**

In September 2022, an allegedly developer leaking the builder for the gang's newest encryptor. A threat actor named Ali Quashji claimed on Twitter to have hacked several LockBit’s servers and obtained the LockBit 3.0 builder and the keys generator. Vx-underground, which provides malware samples and other resources, said that they were contacted on September 10th, 2022, by a user named 'protonleaks,' who also shared a copy of the builder.

The leaked zip file contains a folder named “Build,” two executables, one batch, and one JSON file. The builder does not have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and executes via batch file.

The execution workflow is as follows:
* The “Build.bat” file executes “keygen.exe” and “builder.exe.”  
* “Keygen.exe” is used to generate cryptographic keys.
* “Builder.exe” creates the payload, decryptor, .txt, and other DLL files and saves them to a folder named “Build”.

The leaked LockBit 3.0 builder allows anyone to quickly build the executables required to launch their own operation, including an encryptor, decryptor, and specialized tools to launch the decryptor in certain ways.


## LockBit Green
In late January 2023, vx-underground announced that the LockBit group uses a new ransomware variant - LockBit Green. From ransomware samples shared by Prodaft, the malware was compiled on December 26, 2022.

This is not an in-house developed variant, but a modified pre-existing ransomware. LockBit Green is **based on the leaked source code of the Conti ransomware**.

The **ransom notes** have been modified to use the LockBit 3.0 ransom note rather than Conti's format. Of note, LockBit Green uses a **random extension** rather than the standard .lockbit extension.""" ;

	stix:description '''CaddyWiper is a wiper first observed by ESET researchers on March 14, 2022, targeting Ukraine during the Ukraine-Russia conflict. It is the fourth wiper used during this conflict after WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, and IsaacWiper. The wiper erases user data and partition information from attached drives. CaddyWiper was observed deployed via GPO indicating that the threat actor probably compromised the Active Directory server. CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers. This is probably a way for the attackers to keep their access inside the organization while still disturbing operations.

According to ESET, "TailJump", a variant of CaddyWiper has been used on April 8, 2022 during an attack against an Ukrainian energy company, in parallel of the malware Industroyer2, which has been developped by the Sandworm intrusion set. Therefore, it is strongly likely that CaddyWiper has been developped by the Sandworm intrusion set. This version is a slightly modified version of CaddyWiper encrypted using a single-byte XOR key. This version is loaded and decrypted by ARGUEPATCH.

CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarity with HermeticWiper or IsaacWiper, two wiper that appear in the same context. The samples are not digitally signed.

	stix:description """**DDoSia** is a DDoS attack toolkit, devleopped and used by pro Russia hacktivist nationalist group [NoName057(16)](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--b64214ae-c74f-49a5-a979-c2f36d581247) against countries critical of Russian invasion of Ukraine.

DDoSia project was launched on Telegram, where operators posted a link to GitHub with instructions for potential “volunteers”. The group's main Telegram channel reached more than 13,000 subscribers but only 400 are active participants.

DDoSia volunteers register via Telegram to receive a ZIP archive with malware (dosia.exe) that contains a unique ID for each user. The most interesting feature of this project is the fact that participants can link their ID to a cryptocurrency wallet and receive money for participating in DDoS attacks. Moreover, payment is proportional to the capacities provided by a particular participant.

## DDoSia Description

According to Avast, the first version of DDoSia was written in Python using threads as a means of parallelism; nevertheless, it was still lacking in terms of efficacy. Since the first version, DDoSia relied on HTTP protocol for C2 communication, with JSON configs distributed by the servers. The lack of efficacy presumably motivated changes in DDOSIA, namely the move from Python to Go that Avast saw in late 2022.

These new versions are also multi-platform, as Avast have seen variants for all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android). Evidently, the bot development is still in progress, as Avast see new functionalities, such as HTTP authentication, being added to DDOSIA along with slight changes in the configuration file.

The names of the executable are changed sometimes; there is a list of the captured names:

* `dosia_app_(windows|macos|linux)_(x64|arm64)`
* `d_(win|mac|linux)_(x64|arm64)`
* `pd_(win|mac|linux)_(x64|arm64)`
* `dosia_(win|mac|linux)_(x64|arm64)`

A working dir of the bot executable must contain a text file `client_id.txt` with the User-Hash of the registered user. The form of the User-Hash is a BCrypt hash with these parameters `$2a$16$`.
The first outcome communication is to use `nordvpn.com` to get detailed information about the bot IP address that is sent to the C2 server. The second outcome is to use C2 as a POST method to `/login` URL with data representing information about the bot IP, user ID, and bot identification.

If the authentication is successful, C2 returns `HTTP/1.1 200` OK with a token in the form of epoch/Unix timestamp, and the target configuration can then be downloaded via `GET /client/get_targets`. 

The new configuration supports four attack types: `http`, `http2`, `nginx_loris`, and `tcp`.

Continuous statistics are sent each ~four minutes back to the C2 server through `POST /set_attack_count`.

FireEye has linked the malware to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).

The malware was first discovered following a cyberattack on a Saudi petrochemical plant in August 2017. Nonetheless, a bug in the code prevented the malware from achieving the intended damage because it triggered an emergency shutdown of critical systems. The attackers' goal was potentially to cause the explosion of the plant.

TRITON malware has multiple components, including a custom Python script, four Python modules, and malicious shellcode that contains an injector and a payload

Triton malware is capable of reprogramming Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers manufactured by Schneider Electric. These controllers are part of the last line of defense to prevent critical failures and possible disasters in industrial facilities. They are designed to automatically shut down equipment and processes if they exceed safe operating parameters.

On March 24, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indicments of a Russian Federation Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) employee which was a co-conspirator in the deployment of the TRITON malware in 2017.

	stix:description """**Mallox** (also known as **Fargo** and **TargetCompany**) is a ransomware strain active since mid-June 2021 (June 12, 2021, if we look back at the oldest sample Sekoia.io could collect in open source), and one of the prominent ransomware families targeting unsecured MS-SQL servers. It is owned by the [Mallox ransomware group](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--82c5df07-1752-4570-9aa1-fe1f236be559) who declared it acquired the project from another threat group.

According to ID-Ransomware and BleepingComputer, the Mallox ransomware was distributed under the **`mawahelper `** identity since at least February 2023.

In June 2023, AhnLab observed a version of the Mallox ransomware with the .bat file extension used to encrypt data of poorly managed MS-SQL servers.

## Initial Access
Database servers are often compromised through brute-force and dictionary attacks that are successful against accounts protected with weak credentials. Alternatively, cybercriminals try to exploit known vulnerabilities that the target has not patched.

In June 2023, Mallox was reported beying deployed using BatLoader.

As of August 2023, the intrusion set is reported to mainly exploit vulnerable SQL Servers to gain access.

 ## Background
This malware family is reffering to as **Mallox** because it used to append the “.mallox” extension to the files it encrypts since at least October 2021, but it was also recently tracked as **Fargo** by security researchers.

The ransomware actors also use the name Mallox in their ransom notes, on their Mallox-branded DLS (Data Leak Site) on TOR and on other platforms such as Twitter or Telegram.

Also, this strain is the same that Avast researchers named **TargetCompany** in a report in February 2022, highlighting that files encrypted by it may be recovered for free in some cases.

## Infection and execution
The ransomware infection starts with the MS-SQL process on the compromised machine downloading a .NET file using cmd.exe and powershell.exe.

The payload fetches additional malware (including the locker), generates and runs a BAT file that terminates specific processes and services.

Next, the ransomware payload injects itself into AppLaunch.exe, a legitimate Windows process, and tries to delete the registry key for the open-source ransomware “vaccine” called Raccine.

Additionally, the malware executes the recovery deactivation command and terminates database-related processes to make their contents available for encryption.

## Encryption

When the ransomware encrypts files, files with file extensions shown below are excluded from infection. The characteristic aspect is that it does not infect files with a file extension associated with [Globeimposter](/intelligence/objects/malware--3cade096-ad69-40c1-8034-58fe56090ca0). This exclusion list does not only include the same type of extensions of .FARGO .FARGO2 and .FARGO3 but also includes .FARGO4, which is thought to be a future version of the ransomware.

Figure: Extensions excluded from infection. Source: ASEC.

After the encryption completes, the locked files are renamed using the “.Fargo3” extension (`OriginalFileName.FileExtension.Fargo3`). Other known extensions added to the encrypted files are: `.mallox`, `.exploit`, `.architek`, `.brg`, `.herrco`, `.artiis`, `xollam`, `mawahelper`, `.malox` and others.

Those extensions would sometimes include the name of the attacked company. For some ransomware campaigns, Mallox uses any victim name as extension to an unrelated attack to confuse the victim and the security researchers.

In the group's words, each major ransomware update comes with a change in the extension, \"since the encryption algorithm changed and it was required to use decryptors with different characteristics\".

## Mallox Ransom Note and Ransom Demands
The ransom note is generated with the filename `RECOVERY FILES.txt` (ASEC, September 2022), `HOW TO RECOVER !!.TXT` (Avast, February 2022), `FILE RECOVERY.txt` (SEKOIA.IO, December 2022), `How to decrypt files.txt` (id-ransomware.blogspot.com, April 2023)

The ransom note contains instructions on how to contact the attackers. It urges victims to contact them via their TOR live chat (since at least October 2022) by logging in with a given personal ID, or to send it to a specific email address.

The ransom demands have been reported to range from $1000 to $50,000. Sekoia.io found that in the case of a Colombian-based victim, the ransom amount was reduced from $50,000 to $20,000 within a two-week period.

## Ransomware decryptor tool
In February 2022, the cybersecurity software firm Avast has released a free decryptor tool that facilitate victims of the TargetCompany ransomware in recovering files without paying the ransom demand. However, the free utilities (decryptor tools) are limited; the features can only be used to recover encrypted files “under certain circumstances.” 

## Double Extorsion
In the ransom notes from late 2021 - early 2022 seen by Sekoia.io, the Mallox ransomware actors only asked for a ransom to decrypt victims' data.

Later in 2022, the group started to communicate about its double extortion tactic by threatening to publish the victims' stolen data initially on Twitter (starting from August 2022) and Telegram: \"In case of non-payment of the ransom, your data may be published in the public domain\".

Then beginning from November 2022, Mallox started to use a dedicated TOR site for double extorsion. When a victim does not pay the ransom, the exfiltrated data is released on the group's public data leak site.

	stix:description '[Shamoon](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0140) is wiper malware that was first used by an Iranian group known as the "Cutting Sword of Justice" in 2012. Other versions known as Shamoon 2 and Shamoon 3 were observed in 2016 and 2018. [Shamoon](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0140) has also been seen leveraging [RawDisk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0364) and Filerase to carry out data wiping tasks. The term Shamoon is sometimes used to refer to the group using the malware as well as the malware itself.(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018)(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)' ;

The **Federal Security Service** of the [Russian Federation](/intelligence/objects/location--1175a3bd-dd53-4a7e-9cdd-50743079025a) (**FSB**), known as the Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti in Russian, is one of the main intelligence agencies and the **successor of the Soviet Union’s KGB**. Its missions are to insure **counter-intelligence**, **internal** and **border security**, **counter-terrorism**, and **surveillance** as well as investigating some other types of serious crimes and federal law violations. 

The Federal Security Service is **accountable of the regime’s political stability**, which includes to fight “against terrorism and extremism” — meaning, in facts, against **all those who could challenge the regime**; to monitor the political opposition; to survey the borders; and even to manage part of the intelligence activities. Thus, even if the FSB does not explicitly have foreign or military intelligence objectives, it seems that this institution does conduct such operations. For fact, in the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, media reported FSB top operatives being fired for misjudging the Ukrainian defense capacities.

The FSB has 150,000 employees, plus 200,000 in charge of border control. The FSB is also the **main agency that regulates laws with the aim of reaching technological independence and information control in a Russian pseudo-closed internet (RUNET)**. 

In March 2018, the **FSB asked for Telegram’s encryption keys**, a Russian messaging service that provides end-to-end encrypted communications. Facing Telegram rejection, the media surveillance administration Roskomnadzor threatened to shut down Telegram in Russia. The blocking led to interruptions of many third-party Russian services, but practically did not affect the availability of Telegram in Russia and was officially unblocked on June 19, 2020.

In opposition to the APTs working under the military intelligence service GRU, the APTs linked to the FSB (such as [Turla](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--124a5f78-1a1c-47b4-8c9a-979b5599852d), [Dragonfly](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--003b5bbc-38bc-4591-9f62-54f58e7248d2), [DragonFly 2.0](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--d53a0de7-72a3-4410-8e4a-1ffef7cd519a), [Garmaredon](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--e307cf3d-f51d-4f2c-bbc3-b5b90cec9bdd)) **focus more on targeted and strategic cyber espionage**, internally and internationally, **than destructive operations** (prepositioning and actual cyber sabotage). Moreover, the FSB is **allegedly the main point of contact for Russian-aligned cybercrime groups**, such as the Conti ransomware group (more details below).

The FSB is known to have conducted a multi-stage campaign operations, between at least 2011 to 2018, in which they gained remote access to U.S. and international **Energy Sector** networks, deployed **ICS-focused malware**, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.  

# FSB Cyber Unit and APTs linked
<br>

* **Center 16** aka Military **Unit 71330** aka Special Communications Service of Russia
<br>

Center 16 **operates** [**Dragonfly**](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--003b5bbc-38bc-4591-9f62-54f58e7248d2) (aka Energetic Bear aka Berserk Bear) **and** [**DragonFly 2.0**](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--d53a0de7-72a3-4410-8e4a-1ffef7cd519a). There is debate over the extent of overlap between Dragonfly 2.0 and Dragonfly, but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups). The Special Communications Service of Russia also called Center 16 is a **signal Intelligence (SIGINT) unit** which can collect radio, satellite, mobile phone, and data communications. Center 16 is **hypothetically the main offensive capability** of the FSB according to some observers.

* **Center 18** aka Military **Unit 64829** aka Information Security Center (TsIB)
<br>

Center 18 **operates** [**Gamaredon**](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--e307cf3d-f51d-4f2c-bbc3-b5b90cec9bdd) (aka ACTINIUM aka Armageddon), [**TURLA**](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--124a5f78-1a1c-47b4-8c9a-979b5599852d) (aka Venomous Bear) **and** [**Calisto**](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--a4a994d1-95e4-4046-8930-ff3d2cd985ea). TURLA is alledgly operated in coordination with Center 16 for the SIGINT capabilities. The Center for Information Security (TsIB) seems to be an more **defensive** and **targeted espionage unit** of the FSB according to open-source publications. This is in line with **Garmagedon and Turla’s espionage-driven operations** when DragonFly (offensive center 16) includes destructive operations. Center 18 alledgly operates the System for Operative Investigative Activities (**SORM**), a technical solution for lawful **telecommunications interception** operating in Russia. On 7 Dec 2023, a [joint attribution](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/star-blizzard-continues-spear-phishing-campaigns) from the US, UK and 5Eyes assessed Calisto is almost certainly subordinate to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Centre 18.

It declares owning a C++ ransomware for rent and proposes a web panel with price adjustment for victims and chat rooms, and support services to affiliates.

It is likely that `Mallx` manages the Mallox RaaS program and splits the ransom 80/20 with affiliates.

`Mallx` writes its posts in both Russian and English and operates on the RAMP cybercrime forum since November 12, 2022:

	stix:description """<br>The **General Staff of the Armed Forces** of the Russian Federation (Glavnoye Razvedyvatelnoye Upravlenie) is a military intelligence service which aim is to provide intelligence to the Ministry of Defense, the military leadership and Russian armed forces as a whole. This institution has been **reformed in 2010** and presents now a new acronym, **GU**, but is **still widely known under the GRU acronym** that we use in this description. 

Unlike Russia's other security and intelligence agencies such as the FSB and the SVR, which report to the president of the Russian Federation, the **head of the GRU is subordinate to the Russian military command**, reporting to the Minister of Defense. The Main Directorate controls the military intelligence service and maintains its own Special Forces units known as Spetsnaz. Although its missions are supposed to focus on intelligence collection to support military decision-making, the **GRU is in fact Russia's largest foreign-intelligence agency** conducting covert operations to **support foreign policy objectives**.

Since 2004, the GRU has **developed significant cyber capabilities**, mixing it with its historical experience in conducting **psychological and information operations** inherited from the Soviet propaganda era. Russian military doctrine now includes a **new view of warfare** where the line between peace and conflict is blurred. In order to exploit this situation, the GRU considers that non-violent tools are important, thus **cyber operations as an effective and cheap tool** to **undermine, subvert, and manipulate** an adversary. This doctrine is the reason why, among classic espionage purposes, cyber operations detected from **GRU subgroups show deception, manipulation and sabotage objectives** when the FSB and the SVR operations are more silent and covert spying-oriented cyber operations.

In line with the Russian government goals, the GRU seeks to manipulate domestic audiences and **undermine faith in democratic systems of government**. For example, in the context of the 2016 US presidential election, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been targeted in order to leak information with the purpose of undermining candidate Clinton. A GRU's operation has been exposed targeting the 2017 French presidential election where operatives leaked information from Macron’s EM! party. Instead of seeking a particular candidate (as it was assumed for Trump), **the goal for Russian information operations focuses more on causing chaos and weakening the domestic legitimacy** of an adversary’s government.<br>

### GRU Cyber Units and APTs

<br>

* **Unit 26165** aka 85th Main Special Service Center

Unit 26165 **operates the intrusion set [APT 28](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--40479e35-a7ca-4c05-998d-2cf21ab751cc)** (aka Fancy Bear aka Sofacy). Unit 26165 is a **SIGINT unit** that collects information for various customers, including other GRU units responsible for covert operations. The unit, which is also known as the GRU 85 Main Special Service Center, is located at 20 Komsomolskiy Prospekt, Moscow. Unit 26165 conducted the **operation to exfiltrate emails** associated with **Hillary Clinton**’s presidential election campaign and the Democratic National Committee in 2016, **then gave it to Unit 74455 to organize the  DCLeaks campaign** in parallel to the creation of Guccifer 2.0 avatar. The GRU officers arrested in the Netherlands while conducting a close access operation against the OPCW network were also from Unit 26165.

* **Unit 74455** aka Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST)

Unit 74455 **operates the intrusion set [Sandworm](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--f29bd8cc-1cea-497c-ac3f-8d590b95c9d6)** (aka Telebots aka IRIDIUM). Unit 74455 appears to be a recent unit created to help support and expand the GRU’s cyber operation and information warfare. Unit 74455, is also known as the Main Center for Special Technologies, and is commonly referred to by media reports and the U.S. government as Sandworm. Located in the Moscow suburbs, Unit 74455 is suspected to have built and manipulated the **Guccifer 2.0 avatar** used to leak information from the **2016 DNC hack**. 
This unit is **specialized into hybrid, destructive and destabilization operations** such as the MacronLeaks, the 2017 NotPetya attack or the Industroyer campaigns against the Ukrainian power grid.

* **Unit 54777** aka 72nd Special Service Center

The Special Service Center is reportedly responsible for the **GRU’s psychological operations** that maintain front organizations, including **InfoRos** and the Institute of the Russian Diaspora. 
InfoRos was named in the 2021 US sanctions as an **organization that spreads false conspiracy narratives** and disinformation promoted by GRU officials (COVID-19  spreading through OTAN soldiers disinformation campaigns). According to open-source publications, GRU’s InfoRos has registered about 1,300 online « news websites » including in the domestic web (attached to cities, towns, districts, or even villages) in order to amplify that broadcast the Russian government’s narrative. **There is no known intrusion set linked to this unit**.

* **Unknown GRU unit** 

Not enough technical clues or open-sources publications attribute **the intrusion set [Ember Bear](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--545e1e88-42d7-43ec-816e-0702bef0dacd)** (aka Lorec53 aka UAC-0056) to a specific GRU unit. Howerver, according to Crowdstrike, **Ember Bear TTPs are consistent with other GRU cyber operations**. This group has operated against government and military organizations in Eastern Europe since early 2021, likely to **collect intelligence** from target networks. Crowdstrike attributes the WhisperGate sabotage campaign to Ember Bear with moderate confidence. On January 31, 2022, CERT-UA publicly attributed to Ember Bear an attack targeting an energy organization in Ukraine. 

* The **Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics** 

This institution, which is a research organization part of the Russian Ministry of Defence, but is not under direct GRU administration, **operates the intrustion set [XENOTIME](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--7b3fddaf-ee4d-4009-bd04-fccfdbeeee43)** (aka TEMP.Veles aka Triton).  XENOTIME operators associated with the Institute have **developed destructive ICS malware** known as **Triton** (also called HatMan and TRISIS) which has been exposed and sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO) for a 2017 incident that involved safety override controls in a foreign oil refinery.

### GRU’s most exposed cyber operations (not exclusive)

<br>

* **CyberBerkut ([APT 28](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--40479e35-a7ca-4c05-998d-2cf21ab751cc))** – During the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, a series of malicious activities against Kyiv electoral institutions - including destructive operations,  data leak and DDoS attack, where performed under the CyberBerkut avatar, in an attempt to undermine and/or influence election resultats.
* **TV5 Monde (APT28)** – A 2015 false flag destructive cyberattack that shut down every broadcast channel of the French international TV network while diffusing fake Islamic State propaganda. The attack was conducted by APT28 in retaliation from the French position on the 2014 Crimean Invasion and for the delivery cancellation of two French Mistral-class helicopter carriers ordered in 2010 by Russia.
* **Ukraine power grid hack ([Sandworm](/intelligence/objects/intrusion-set--f29bd8cc-1cea-497c-ac3f-8d590b95c9d6))** – December 2015 destructive attacks on Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure, Ministry of Finance, and State Treasury Service.
* **DCLeaks (APT28 and Sandworm)** – During the 2016 US presidential election, APT28 and Sandworm targeted DNC’s email network (among other targets such as voting machines), and dumped emails from Democratic Party leaders. The leak was orchestrated with the creation of Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks websites in order to mess with the election and undermine US institutions.
* **MacronLeaks (APT28 and Sandworm)** – 2017 hack-and-leak operation targeting French President Emmanuel Macron’s emails and interference in France’s presidential election.
* **[NotPetya](/intelligence/objects/campaign--595f55b5-0e99-412b-9a0c-5a5cecd9cd2d) ransomware (Sandworm)** – 2017 ransomware attack initially targeting Ukraine but which infected computers globally and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.
* **[Olympic Destroyer](/intelligence/objects/campaign--c7bb8f6b-0092-49a7-8b88-d356c0ef61ff) (Sandworm)** – 2018 false flag destructive cyber operation against the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea. Operators tried to disguise themselves as North Korean operatives by using known TTPs attributed to the Lazarus intrusion set.
* **OPCW close access operation (Sandworm)** – In 2018, in a global cyber offensive campaign against UK and European institutions, GRU officers have been arrested in the Netherlands trying to access the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigating the nerve agent attack against Sergei Skripal.
